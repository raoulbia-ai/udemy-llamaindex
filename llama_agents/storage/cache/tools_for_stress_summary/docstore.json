And I'm a Professor of Neurobiology and \nOphthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. This podcast is separate from my \nteaching and research ro les at Stanford. It is however, part of my desire and effort to \nbring zero cost to consumer information about science and science -related tools to the \ngeneral public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's \npodcast. Our first sponsor is InsideTracker. InsideTracker analyzes your blood and DNA \nto give you an accurate assessment of your health and your biological age. There are \nmany things about our health that can only be analyzed from blood and DNA tests. I've \nbeen getting my b lood assessed for many years now. And about a year ago, I switched \nto InsideTracker. What I like about InsideTracker is that you get all this information back \nabout metabolic factors, endocrine factors, et cetera, that are really important to your \nhealth. But unlike a lot of blood tests where you just get all the numbers back and it tells \nyou whether or not things are high, normal, or low, InsideTracker also has this really \nuseful and really easy -to-use dashboard that takes the information for your blood an d \nDNA tests and points you toward particular behavioral, nutritional, and other sorts of \nprotocols that you can use to get the numbers where you want them for your health.

Again, their programs allow you to assess your \nhealth from the inside, things that you could just never assess from any kind of test that \ndidn't involve blood and DNA. And it also has this really interesting f eature that it can \nmeasure your inner age, which is based on biology. Your chronological age, of course, is \nvery informative about your health and where you ought to be in terms of health metrics, \nbut people vary. We know people, of course, that are in the ir late 90s who are doing \nwell. We know people that are in their 50s who are struggling or even in their 20s. So, \nblood and DNA are the way to analyze your health. That's my belief. That's why I use \nInsideTracker. So, go to insidetracker.com/huberman to ge t 25% off any of their \nproducts and use \"Huberman\" at checkout. Our second sponsor of today's episode is \nHelix Sleep. Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows that are ideally suited to your \nneeds for the best night's sleep possible. I switched to using a Helix mattress and Helix \npillow this last year and I'm sleeping better than I ever have before. The way that Helix \nmattresses work and the reason they're different, is that they are tailored to your \nindividual sleep style. Your sleep style can be assessed by going to their website, you \ntake a brief two -minute questionnaire quiz. Asks you questions like, do you sleep on \nyour back or your side or your stomach? Maybe you don't know or maybe you move \naround a lot during the night. It also asks you questions suc h as do you tend to run hot \nor wake up cold, things of that sort. And then they tailor a particular mattress to your \nsleep needs. For me, I matched to the so -called Dusk, D -U-S-K mattress. And I love it. I \nsleep better than ever. And right now, if you want  to try Helix Sleep you can go to \nhelixsleep.com/huberman. And if you do that, you'll get $200 off your order plus two free \npillows. They also have a great warranty. They have a 10 -year warranty on their \nmattresses. If you don't like the mattress for any r eason, they'll pick it up for free from \nyour home. And they just make the whole thing really easy to try and determine whether \nor not it's right for you. So again, it's helixsleep.com/huberman to get $200 off and two \nfree pillows on your first order. Some of you have asked how you can help support the \npodcast in yet other ways, besides just checking out our sponsors. We really appreciate \nthe question and we've set up a Patreon account at patreon.com/AndrewHuberman \nwhich allows you to donate to the podcast a t a variety of different levels.

Today's episode is going  to be all about the science of emotions. The first month of \nthe podcast, we talked about sleep and wakefulness. Last month, we were talking about \nneuroplasticity, the brain's ability to change in response to experience. And this month \nwe're going to talk about these things that we call emotions. We're going to decipher \nwhat they are, how they work, how we can control them when we might not want to \ncontrol them. There are going to be four episodes on emotions. And today, we're going \nto talk in particular ab out something that most often is called stress. Now, you might be \nthinking, \"Wait, stress isn't an emotion.\" But stress really lies at the heart of whether or \nnot our internal experience is matched well or not to our external experience where the \nevents th at are happening to us and around us. And as you'll soon, see those converge \nor combine to create what we call emotions. Now, I want to be very clear that we're \ngoing to talk about the biology of emotions, we're going to talk a little bit about some \npsycho logical concepts related to emotion, and we are definitely going to talk about tools \nto control what we call stress or commonly think of as stress. We're also going to clean \nup some common myths about stress. For instance, that stress impairs your immune \nsystem. That's true in certain contexts. And in other contexts, stress actually enhances \nyour immune system and makes it function better. There is going to be a lot of \ndiscussion about whether or not our internal state, whether or not we are alert or calm i s \ngood or bad, depending on the circumstances. So, where we're headed here is I'd like \nyou to come away from today's episode with what I call an organizational logic, a \nframework for thinking about these things that typically we just call happy or sad or \ndepressed or anxious. And I'm going to make sure that you have tools that are grounded \nin physiology and neuroscience that will allow you to navigate this otherwise complex \nspace that we call emotions that will allow you to ground yourself better when you'r e \nfeeling like life is weighing on you, where you're kind of being pulled by the currents of \nlife as well as to support other people whether or not that's in a psychological practice if \nyou're a practitioner, or you have clients or children or spouses, rea lly, to be able to", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2777, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ccc3e4be-7ba9-4732-897e-4eef06855608": {"__data__": {"id_": "ccc3e4be-7ba9-4732-897e-4eef06855608", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "10_Tools_for_Managing_Stress_&_Anxiety_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_10.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d175e43a-45a4-4b09-9b62-568df0ecf644", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "10_Tools_for_Managing_Stress_&_Anxiety_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_10.pdf"}, "hash": "74b01bb7de803ba8fe61733c9e5cf4356e0bd09ce62e582303b24f1cbfc2c6c9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "99ed0b3a-89e2-4967-815d-3134993e5010", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "10_Tools_for_Managing_Stress_&_Anxiety_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_10.pdf"}, "hash": "b9c33071e7f6d88bfe8b6db31df6a0f595f9d142384b70a8d6b385e92eb1def9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6df0bae7-daf8-48e7-8be1-6c0b4ca7c0d8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "bb77ae1d17c2f9d9fd022db4ed8ed5ffe5e22730732fc183ccf6c5f374883b62", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "dd017e489b104f36f924234f843b718ab15a28cdd1e26e7ce38224fad6dd19c3", "text": "Transcribed by readthatpodcast.com  \nsupport other people in your environment better. And the tools that I'm going to focus on \ntoday range from behavioral tools. We will talk about some of the more valuable \nsupplementation tools that are out there. And we're going to talk a  little bit about things \nlike depression, PTSD, but we will be devoting entire episodes to things like depression, \nPTSD, and even attention deficit and obsessive compulsive disorder, which believe it or \nnot, although this might not surprise many of you, ha ve a very strong emotional \ncomponent. It's just not just about compulsive behaviors and intrusive thoughts. It's also \nabout the emotional load of being in that state. So, I promise that today we're going to \nclean up a lot of misunderstanding. We're going t o give you a lot of tools and you're \ngoing to learn a lot about the biology of how your body and brain work together. Because \nif ever there was a topic that brought together the brain and body or mind -body \nrelationship, it's stress and emotions. It's also the positive emotions. When we feel \nsomething, whether or not we're super happy or just feeling kind of pleasant or we are \nfeeling stressed, anxious, and overwhelmed, it isn't just in our head. It's also in our body. \nAnd as you may recall, the nervous syst em, which includes the brain and the eyes and \nthe spinal cord, but also all the connections with the organs of the body includes the \nbrain and body. And those organs of the body, your gut, and your liver, and your spleen, \nthey're also communicating with th e brain. So, I look forward to a day, in fact, when we \nno longer think about neuroscience as just the brain. And many neuroscientists now also \nthink about the body, of course. And the brain controls the body, but the body is also \nhaving a very profound and  concrete influence on the brain. I think up until recently, \npeople would hear about kind of brain -body and always think about mindfulness. We're \nactually not going to talk that much about mindfulness at all today. Mindfulness is kind of \na vague concept, i n fact. When you think about mindfulness, it's good to take the \nopposite. What's the opposite of mindfulness? Would be mindlessness. Well, all of a \nsudden we're into territory that isn't really easy for one person to describe their \nexperience or to help ot hers with their experience. Today, we're going to talk about \nobjective tools that match the brain -body experience or separate the brain -body \nexperience in ways that leverage your ability to lean into life better, to feel better, literally \nto just feel bett er about what you're experiencing, and believe it or not, to be able to \ncontrol your emotions when that's appropriate. This isn't about becoming robotic. This \nisn't about trying not to feel human. This is actually about being able to lean into life \nbetter as a consequence of being able to control some of your inner real estate.

So, it's to place you in a greater position of power. And \nso, let's get started in deciphering what is stress, what are emotions, and why did I batch \nstress and emotions into one discussion today?  \n \n00:10:29 Stress: The (Falsely Narrow) Animal Attack Narrative  \n \nOkay. So, what is stress? We hear all the time that str ess is bad. We hear people saying \nthey're really stressed out. What is stress? You've all presumably heard the arguments \nor the framework that stress is this horrible ancient carryover over from times in which \nhumans were pursued by animals or other human predators and that whenever we feel \nwhat we call stress or feel stressed out, that it's just this unfortunate invasion of \nsomething that we no longer need in modern life, that this was designed for when we \nwere being attacked by bears or tigers or lions or  whatever it is. And gosh, what an \nunfortunate thing. And we have so many creature comforts nowadays, but we have not \neliminated this stress. Almost as if it was like an organ or a system in our body that was \nbad for us, that we're stuck with just because of the species that we are. But first of all, \nall species experience stress. And I think that it's fair to say even though I wasn't there, \nthat yes, in fact, throughout our evolutionary history, we were vulnerable to animal attack \nand other human attacks o n a regular basis up until a point where we started developing \nweapons and structures and fire and other things that allow us to protect ourselves \nbetter from those animals and invaders of various kinds. But it is entirely naive for us to \nthink that in anc ient times, ancient times being kind of loose term for previous on \nmedieval times, 100 years ago, 1000 years ago, 10,000 years ago, of course, there were \ninfidelities, right? Partners cheated. People died. In fact, before the advent of phones, \nwhich we're going to talk about today, you can imagine that someone might head off on \na hunt or to go visit a relative and never come back and you would never know why. \nThat would be very stressful. So, there was psychosocial stress. There was the stress of \nlosing lov ed ones. There was the stress of cold, of famine. There was the stress \nprobably also of just worry. This idea that ancient versions of humans 1000 years ago, \n100 years ago didn't worry, I think that is entirely inconsistent with everything we know \nabout th e structure of the human brain 100 years, 1000 years ago. So, all the problems \nthat we're struggling with existed forever. It's just that stress at its core is a generalized \nsystem. It wasn't designed for tigers attacking us or people attacking us. It's a system to \nmobilize other systems in the brain and body. That's what stress really is.

And that's the most important thing that I'd like you to understand today, is \nthat the system that governs what we call stress is generic. It  wasn't designed for one \nthing. And that gives it a certain advantage in taking over the state of our brain and body, \nbut it also gives you, all of us an advantage in controlling it because it's based on hard -\nwired biological mechanisms and there are hard -wired biological mechanisms, meaning \ncells and chemicals and pathways and tissues that exist in you right now that require no \nneuroplasticity that allow you to put a brake on stress. And so, we're going to talk about \nthose. So, you have a system for stress  and you have a system for distress that are \nbaked into you. They were genetically encoded. And you were born with them and you \nstill have them now. So, if you're alive and listening, you have the capacity to control \nyour stress. And today, I'm going to ta lk about ways that you can control your stress, not \njust by doing some offline practice of meditation or breath work or something like that, \nbut real -time tools. Tools that allow you to push back on stress when stress hits in real \ntime. This is something t hat my lab works actively on in developing and testing these \ntools  \n \n00:14:31 The Stress RESPONSE: Generic, Channels blood, Biases Action  \n \nand evolving these tools. And there are other laboratories that do this as well. So, let's \ntalk about the stress res ponse. And by doing that, you will understand exactly why the \ntools I'm going to give you work. For those of you that are saying, \"Wait, I just want the \ntools. Just give me a summary,\" trust me, if you understand mechanism, you are going \nto be in a far bet ter position to incorporate these tools, to teach these tools to others, and \nto modify them as your life circumstances change. If you'd like the cheat sheet or you \njust want the one -page PDF, eventually we'll get that stuff out to people, but it's really \nimportant to understand the underlying mechanism. Okay. So, what is stress? Well, let's \njust distinguish between stressors, which are the things that stress us out, and stress, \nwhich is the psychological and physiological response to stressors. I'm mainly g oing to \ntalk about stress, which is your response to things. Let's be clear about what we already \nknow, which is that stressors can be psychological or they can be physical. Okay? If I \nput you outside on a cold day without a jacket for a very long time, th at is stressful. If I \nhave you prepare for too many exams at once and you can't balance it all with your \nsleep schedule and your other needs for comfort and wellbeing, like food, rest, sleep, \nand social connection, that is stressful.

So, what happens when \nthe stress response hits? Let's talk about the immediate or what we call the acute stress \nresponse. We could also think of this as short -term s tress. So, you have a collection of \nneurons. They have a name. It's called the sympathetic chain ganglia. And it has nothing \nto do with sympathy. Sympa means together. And there's a group of neurons that start \nright about at your neck and run down to about  your navel, a little bit lower, and those \nare called the sympathetic chain ganglia. You don't need to memorize that name. There \nwill not be a quiz. But it's important to know that in the middle of your body, you have a \nchain of neurons that when something  stresses us out, either in our mind or because \nsomething enters our environment and we see something that stresses us out, that we \ndon't like heights if you're afraid of heights, somebody you dislike walks into the room, et \ncetera, that chain of neurons b ecomes activated like a bunch of dominoes falling on all \nat once. It's very fast. When that happens, those neurons release a neuromodulator \nneurochemical that I've talked about before on this podcast called acetylcholine. They \nrelease that at various sites  within the body. Now, this is important because normally, \nacetylcholine would be used to move muscles. Actually, every time we move a muscle, \npick up a cup of coffee, write with a pen, walk down the street, it's spinal neurons \nconnecting to muscle and rel easing acetylcholine. So, in the brain it's involved in focus \nand it muscles is involved in making muscles twitch. But if we were stressed, we \nwouldn't want all our muscles to contract at once because we would just be kind of like \nparalyzed like this in wh at tonic activation, as it's called. We wouldn't want that. \nSomething called tetanus, believe it or not. because the tetanus toxin will cause that kind \nof rigor of the entire body. You do not want that. When those neurons are activated, \nacetylcholine is re leased, but there are some other neurons for the aficionados out there. \nThey're called the postganglionic neurons. Those ones respond to that acetylcholine and \nthen they release epinephrine, which is the equivalent to adrenaline. So, we have this \nsystem wh ere it's very fast whenever we're stressed, the core of our body, these \nneurons down the middle of our body release these chemicals and then there's \nadrenaline or epinephrine released at particular organs and acts in particular ways. \nWe're going down into the weeds here.

They get bigger and blood rushes in to our legs. \nThe heart rate speed s up. Lots of things happen that get activated. And at the same \ntime, that epinephrine activates other receptors on certain tissues that we don't need. \nThe ones involved in digestion, reproduction, and things of that sort that are luxuries for \nwhen things are going well, not things to pay attention to when we're stressed. And that \nbinds to other receptors that contract the blood vessels. So, basically the stress \nresponse, this is the key phrase here, the stress response A, is generic, I said that \nbefore, an d B, it basically pushes certain systems to be activated and other systems to \nnot be activated. So, the stress response is two -pronged. It's a yes for certain things and \nit's a no, you may not right now for other things. So, that's the key thing to underst and \nabout the stress response. That's why your heart speeds up. That's why you feel blood \nin certain organs and tissues of your body, but not in others. That's why your throat goes \ndry because it turns out that when you get stressed, the salivary glands ar e shut down. \nThere's a lot less blood flow to the neurons that control salivation. And so, you're going \nto start swallowing. You feel like your throat is getting dry. There are a lot of different \neffects. I'm not going to list them all off, but basically, you are activated in ways that \nsupport you moving. So, that's the third thing. It's first of all, it's generic. Second of all, \nthe stress response, activate certain things and shuts down other features of our body. \nAnd then it's a sense of agitation that m akes you want to move. And that's because \nfundamentally, the stress response is just this generic thing that says do something. And \nmovement in this case can either be the bias to move in terms of action, or it can be the \nbias to say something. When we are  stressed, we are more likely to say something that \nprobably we shouldn't say. We are more likely to move. And if you're trying to suppress \nmovement, you'll feel that as a tremor. You're going to feel agitated and that's because it \nwas designed to move you .

So, we're \ntaking the podium or we're sitt ing down at a Zoom call, and all of a sudden we're feeling \nflushed. We're feeling like our heart is racing. We're feeling a little too alert. We're feeling \na little worked up and we want to calm down. As far as I am aware of, the best tools to \nreduce stres s quickly, so -called real -time tools are going to be tools that have a direct \nline to the so -called autonomic nervous system. The autonomic nervous system is a \nname given to the kind of general features of alertness or calmness in the body. \nTypically, it m eans automatic. Although we do have some control over it at certain what \nso-called leavers are entry points. Here's what doesn't work to control stress. Telling \nyourself to calm down. In fact, that tends to just exacerbate stress. Telling someone else \nto calm down also tends to exacerbate their stress. If you want to reduce the magnitude \nof the stress response, the best thing you can do is activate the other system in the body \nwhich is designed for calming and relaxation. And that system is called the \nparas ympathetic nervous system. Because as I mentioned before, the neurons that \ncontrol stress run from about your neck to your navel. The parasympathetic neurons, \npara just means near, exist in, they're some of the cranial nerves. So, it's kind of left \nneck an d lower brainstem. Kind of back of the brain and in the neck and in the pelvic \narea. And the parasympathetic nervous system is really interesting because especially \nthe cranial nerves, the ones that are up in the brainstem and in the neck area, those \nhave a direct line to various features of your face, in particular, the eyes. They control \nthings like eye movements, pupil dilation, things of that sort, as well as the tongue, the \nfacial muscles, et cetera. The parasympathetic nervous system, many people don' t \nrealize this, is the system by which we control the face and the eyes, and to some \nextent, our airway, the trachea. And it's these neurons that reside within the pelvic area. \nNow, the neurons within the pelvic area are involved in control of the genitals , the \nbladder, and the rectum. And those don't have a direct line. You don't have a direct way \nto control those. It actually has to go from brain to spinal cord and then out to those \norgans. Whereas the parasympathetic nervous system has certain entry poin ts or what \nI'll call leavers that will allow you to push back on the stress response in real time and \ndiminish it and feel more relaxed really quickly.

And the tool that at least to my knowledge is the fastest and most thoroughly \ngrounded in physiology and neuroscience for calm ing down in a self -directed way is \nwhat's called the physiological sigh, S -I-G-H. Now, some of you might've heard me talk \nabout this on previous podcasts, but I'm going to explain this in the context of how \nrespiration in general is used to calm us down. A nd turns out you're all doing this all the \ntime, but you are doing it involuntarily. And when you stress, you tend to forget that you \ncan also activate these systems voluntarily. This is an extremely powerful set of \ntechniques that we know from scientific studies that are being done in my lab, Jack \nFeldman's lab at UCLA, and others now that are very, very useful for reducing your \nstress response in real time. And here's how they work. These days, there seems to be \na lot of interest in breath work. Breath wo rk typically, is when you go and you sit down or \nyou lie down and you deliberately breathe in a particular way for a series of minutes in \norder to shift your physiology, access some states. And it does have some utility that \nwe're going to talk about, that  is not what I'm talking about now. What I'm talking about \nwhen I refer to physiological sighs, is the very real medical school textbook relationship \nbetween the brain, the body, and the body as it relates to the breathing apparati, \nmeaning the diaphragm a nd lungs and the heart. Let's take the hallmark of the stress \nresponse. The heart starts beating faster. Blood is shuttled to the big muscles of the \nbody to move you away from whatever it is the stressor is or just make you feel like you \nneed to move or ta lk. Your face goes flushed, et cetera. Heart rate, many of us feel is \ninvoluntary. Just kind of functions whether or not we're moving fast or moving slow. If \nyou think about it, it's not really purely autonomic because you can speed up your heart \nrate by r unning or you can slow it down by slowing down your run. You can move to a \nwalk or lie down. But that's indirect control. There is however, a way in which you can \nbreathe that directly controls your heart rate through the interactions between the \nsympathet ic and the parasympathetic nervous system. Here's how it works. When you \ninhale, so whether or not it's through the nose or through the mouth, this skeletal muscle \nthat's inside your body called the diaphragm, it moves down. And that's because the \nlungs ex pand, the diaphragm moves down. Your heart actually gets a little bit bigger in \nthat expanded space. There's more space for the heart. So, not your emotional heart \ngetting bigger. I'm talking about your actual physical heart getting a little bit bigger. Th e \nvolume grows. And as a consequence, whatever blood is in there is now at a lower", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2946, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2f58bea4-867a-4bb2-8188-ab00f7e7e797": {"__data__": {"id_": "2f58bea4-867a-4bb2-8188-ab00f7e7e797", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "10_Tools_for_Managing_Stress_&_Anxiety_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_10.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1dd826df-b42f-406d-a060-9706a48bfe35", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "10_Tools_for_Managing_Stress_&_Anxiety_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_10.pdf"}, "hash": "19ce3cea9d5d365be962e628c8f6222be27b7a1f5865170e7e0d283fd261c734", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0cc975b3-486e-4531-9385-05cfd7d95342", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "10_Tools_for_Managing_Stress_&_Anxiety_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_10.pdf"}, "hash": "8addabf25b5e635d3fc48a2da1caecb796e6b25c64d7dfe3f414dcaaad7f2681", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1a379ecc-05ce-441f-8d72-d859c674606e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ee4cd4a2508e5e330be427bdfa7e98b4d367c832b6cba903485b71b0bc1e130b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "53dbcc441a13005e0ecf747dff94ceb3492b71f7e648607a7dbb249b90c711d9", "text": "Transcribed by readthatpodcast.com  \nvolume or moving a little bit more slowly in that larger volume than it was before you \ninhaled. Okay? So more space, heart gets bigger. Blood moves more slowly. And there's \na little group of neurons called the sinoatrial node in the heart that registers, believe it or \nnot, those neurons pay attention to the rate of blood flow through the heart and send a \nsignal up to the brain that blood is moving more slowly through the hear t. The brain then \nsends a signal back to the heart to speed the heart up. So, what this means is if you \nwant your heart to beat faster, inhale longer, inhale more vigorously than your exhales. \nNow, there are a variety of ways that one could do that, but it  doesn't matter if it's \nthrough the nose or through the mouth. If your inhales are longer than your exhales, \nyou're speeding up your heart. If your inhales are more vigorous, so even if your inhales \nare shorter than your exhales, you are speeding up your h eart rate. Now, the opposite is \nalso true. If you want to slow your heart rate down, so stress response hits, you want to \nslow your heart rate down, what you want to do is again, capitalize on this relationship \nbetween the body, meaning the diaphragm and t he heart and the brain. Here's how it \nworks. When you exhale, the diaphragm moves up, which makes the heart a little bit \nsmaller. It actually gets a little more compact. Blood flows more quickly through that \ncompact space sort of like just a pipe getting s maller. The sinoatrial node registers that \nblood is going more quickly, sends a signal up to the brain. And the parasympathetic \nnervous system, some neurons in your brain stem send a signal back to the heart to \nslow the heart down. So, if you want to calm down quickly, you need to make your \nexhales longer and or more vigorous than your inhales. Now, the reason this is so \nattractive as a tool for controlling stress is that it works in real time. This doesn't involve a \npractice that you have to go and sit the re and do anything separate from life. And we are \ngoing to get to emotion. Emotions and stress happen in real time. And so, while it's \nwonderful to have a breath work practice or to have the opportunity to get a massage or \nsit in a sauna or do whatever it is that you do in order to set your stress controls in the \nright direction, having tools that you can reach to in real time that require no learning, I \nmean, I had to teach it to you, you had to learn that, but it doesn't require any plasticy to \nactivate t hese pathways. So, if you're feeling stressed, you still need to inhale, of course, \nbut you need to lengthen your exhales.

It's now been explored at the neuro -\nbiological level and mechanistically in far more detail by Jack Feldman's lab at UCLA. \nAlso Mark Krasnow's lab at Stanford. And the physiological sigh is something that \nhumans and animals do anytime they are about to fall asleep. You also do it throughout \nsleep from time to time when carbon dioxide, which we'll talk about in a moment, builds \nup too much in your system. And the physiological sigh is something that people \nnaturally start doing when they've been crying and they're trying to recover some air or \ncalm down when they've been sobbing very hard or when they are in claustrophobic \nenvironments. However, the amazing thing about this thing that w e call the diaphragm, \nthe skeletal muscle, is that it's an internal organ that you can control voluntarily, unlike \nyour spleen or your heart or your pancreas where you can't just say, \"Oh, I want to make \nmy pancreas turn out a little more insulin right now . I'm just going to do that with my mind \ndirectly.\" You can't do that. You can do that by smelling a really good donut or \nsomething, but you can't just do it directly. You can move your diaphragm intentionally, \nright? You can do it anytime you want. And it 'll run in the background if you're not \nthinking about it. So, this incredible pathway that goes from brain to diaphragm through \nwhat's called the phrenic nerve, P -H-R-E-N-I-C. Phrenic. The phrenic nerve innervates \nthe diaphragm. You can control anytime yo u want. You can double up your inhales or \ntriple up your inhales. You can exhale more than your inhales. Whatever you want to do. \nSuch an incredible organ. And the physiological sigh is something that we do \nspontaneously. But when you're feeling stressed, you can do a double inhale, [inhales \ndeeply] [exhales] long exhale. Now, I just told you a minute ago that if you inhale more \nthan you exhale, you're going to speed the heart rate up, which would promote more \nstress and activation. Now I'm telling you to d o a double inhale -exhale in order to calm \ndown. And the reason is the double inhale -exhale which is the physiological sigh takes \nadvantage of the fact that when we do a double inhale, even if the second inhale is \nsneaking in just a tiny bit more air, becau se it's kind of hard to get to deep inhales back \nto back, you do big deep inhale and then another little ones sneaking it in, the little sacks \nin your lungs. If you only have the lungs. Your lungs are just two big bags, but you've got \nmillions of little sa cks throughout the lungs that actually make the surface area of your \nlungs as big as a tennis court.

And  \nthen when you do the long exhale, that long exhale is now much more effective at \nreading your body and bloodstream of carbon dioxide, which relaxes you very quickly. \nMy lab in collaboration with David Spiegel's lab, David's the Associate Chair of \nPsychiat ry at Stanford, are doing a study right now exploring how physiological sighs \nand other patterns of breathing done deliberately can modulate the stress response and \nother things related to emotionality. Those work are ongoing. I want to be clear those \nstudies aren't done. But it's very clear from work in our labs, from work in Jack \nFeldman's lab and others, that the physiological sigh is the fastest, hardwired way for us \nto eliminate this stressful response in our body quickly in real time. And so, I'm exci ted to \ngive you this tool because I think most people have heard that mindfulness and \nmeditation is good, exercise is good for us, we all need to be getting enough sleep, et \ncetera, but life happens. And when you find yourself in a position where you are m ore \nalert and activated than you would like to be, regardless of whether or not the stressor is \nrelationship -based or it's financial or it's physical or anything like that, you can look to the \nphysiological sigh because it bypasses a very important feature  of how we function, \nwhich is that it's very hard to control the mind with the mind, especially when we are in \nheightened states of activation. When you're very alert or very sleepy, it is very hard to \nuse these so -called top -down mechanisms of intention a nd gratitude and all these things \nthat are really powerful tools when we are not super activated and stressed or not super \ntired. But when we are anywhere in the range of very alert and stressed to very sleepy, \nphysiological sighs are a powerful way of bri nging our level of so -called autonomic \nactivation, which just means our level of alertness down. And so, whether or not it's in \nline at the bank or whether or not you're wearing a mask nowadays or you're not, \nwhatever the conditions may be where you're at and your needs, when you're feeling \nstressed, the physiological sigh done just one to three times, it will be double inhale, \nexhale, double inhale, exhale maybe just two times will bring down your level of stress \nvery, very fast.  \n \n00:34:53 Important Notes  About Heart Rate Deceleration: Vaso -vagal Lag  \n \nAnd as far as I know, it's the fastest way to accomplish that.

There's actually something \ncalled the vasovagal response, where people will stand up or they'll get up in the middle \nof the night to use the bat hroom and then all of a sudden, they'll collapse, they'll faint. \nThat's because the heart rate was reduced too much. Some people will see blood or \nthey'll see something really troubling and stressful and they'll pass out. That's an over -\nactivation or an ac celeration of the calming response. They're not so stressed that they \nkind of fall off the cliff of stress. They get so stressed that the rebound mechanism for \ncalming themselves down goes too high, too fast. They calmed down too fast and they \ncollapse and  faint. And so, be aware that if you're going to use the physiological sigh or \nexhale -emphasized breathing to calm down, that your heart rate will take about 20 to 30 \nseconds to come down to baseline. And you may need to repeat the physiological sigh a \nfew times. So, that's an important note about the use of breathing to control levels of \nstress. The other thing is that when you decide to look to the body to control the mind, it \ndoes something else that's very powerful. When you are stressed in your mind an d body, \nso you're feeling really agitated, activated, and worried, and you use a tool like the \nphysiological sigh or exhale -emphasized breathing, you will notice that then your brain \nand your mind becomes more available for controlling the stress response and reacting \nto it.

Excellent book. As well as \"Jaws\" wh ich is from Sandra Kahn, Paul \nEhrlich with a foreword by Jared Diamond and Robert Sapolsky. So, a collection of \npeople from Stanford. Jared Diamond is not at Stanford, but the rest are. And some \nheavy hitters on that book, which is about the benefits of na sal breathing. And in many \ncases, nasal breathing is more advantageous than mouth breathing for all sorts of \nthings. Cosmetic features of the face, especially in kids, warding off infection, et cetera. \nWith the physiological sigh, the best way to do it wou ld be double inhale through the \nnose, exhale through the mouth. But if you can't, and you can only do that through your \nmouth, just do it through your mouth. If want to do all through your nose, do it through \nyour nose. This anchors back to some underlying  neurology or neuroscience.  \n \n00:38:46 Two Breathing Centers In The Brain  \n \nSo, for those of you that want to know, you have two breathing centers. One that's \ninvolved in rhythmic breathing for inhales followed by exhales, followed by inhales \nfollowed by e xhales. The so -called pre -Botzinger nucleus named after a bottle of wine \nand discovered by Jack Feldman at UCLA and a nearby nucleus called the parafacial \nnucleus also discovered by Jack Feldman at UCLA. And the parafacial nucleus is \ninvolved in any time y ou double up the inhales or double up the exhales. It was designed \nso that you could breathe while you're speaking because you can't always go inhale, \nexhale, inhale, exhale when you're speaking. So, I tell you this, not to overwhelm you \nwith knowledge, bu t just know that when you double up your inhales or you double up \nyour exhales, you are activating this parafacial nucleus. And it has other cool effects. \nBecause it's located near the neurons that control the face, it also has a tendency to \nrelax the jaw.

So, let's think about something now.  \n \n00:40:39 The 3 Types of Stress: Short, Medium and Long -Term   \n \nLet's think ab out stress from not whether or not it's acute or chronic, whether or not it's \ngood for us or bad for us, but on three different timescales. Because then we can arrive \nat what this is all about as it relates to emotions. Because trust me, this has everythin g \nto do with emotions and whether or not you're functioning well emotionally or you're not \nfunctioning well emotionally, whether or not you're coping or not coping. So, those are \ntypically psychological terms and psychological discussions. We are entering this \nthrough the portal of physiology. The stuff of medical textbooks. And we will arrive at the \npsychology soon, but I really want you to understand the difference between the three \nkinds of stress on three different timescales, short -term, medium -term, a nd long -term, \nand what it's good for and what it's bad for. I think we've all heard that stress is bad for \nus. We've seen these pictures intended to frighten us. And indeed they are frightening. \nYou see the nice really plump brain on the left. It says heal thy or control. And then you \nsee the brain that says stressed above it on the right and it's like withered, where we see \nthat the hippocampus and area involved in memory is smaller.

And it's very important, but I think w e've all heard now so many \ntimes that stress is bad.  \n \n00:42:10 Positive Effects of Short -Term Stress: Immunity and Focus  \n \nBut in that conversation, unfortunately, it's eclipsed some of the really positive things that \nstress does for us in the short -term.  So, stress can be short -term, medium -term, or long -\nterm. Long -term stress is indeed bad for all the reasons I just mentioned and many \nothers. But what's never actually been discussed is what stress is so terrific for, positive \nfor in the short -term. And I  think we tend to overlook the important question, which is \nwhat is short -term and what is long -term? No one ever bothers to tell us what is chronic, \nwhat is acute. Right? Is it five minutes? Is it five days? Is it for the duration of final \nexams? Or is it  for the duration of a senior thesis in college? No one actually draws \nboundaries around this stuff or even general guidelines. And so, it's become a bit of a \nmess, frankly, to try and decipher this whole space around stress. So, I'm going to try \nand clean  some of this up for you based on what we know from the scientific data. First \nof all, acute stress, when the stress response hits, that is good for your immune system. \nI know that might be a tough pill to swallow, but it's absolutely true. In fact, stress  often \ncomes in the form of bacterial or viral infection. And the stress response is in part \norganized to combat bacterial and viral infection. There are pathways from the same \nbrain centers that activate these neurons in your spinal cord to make you feel like you \nwant to move. There are other neurons in your brain that activate things like your spleen, \nwhich will deploy killer cells to go out and scavenge for incoming bacteria and viruses \nand try and eat them up and kill them. So, short -term stress and the  release of \nadrenaline in particular or epinephrine, same thing, adrenaline and epinephrine, is good \nfor combating infection. And this to me is just not discussed enough. So, that's why I'm \ndiscussing it here. And it relates to a particular tool that many of you ask about, but I \ndon't often get the opportunity to talk about in such an appropriate context. It's not that \nit's ever inappropriate to talk about, but what I'm about to talk about now is the use of, \nagain, respiration breathing to somewhat artifici ally activate the stress response. And \nthat will accomplish two things. Okay? I'll return to medium and long -term stress, but I \nwant to say short -term stress is good because the dilation of the pupils, the changes in \nthe optics of the eyes, the quickening of the heart rate, the sharpening of your cognition. \nAnd in fact that short -term stress brings certain elements of the brain online that allow", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2854, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9774a63f-e4c2-4a90-ad12-0da9d8b1e752": {"__data__": {"id_": "9774a63f-e4c2-4a90-ad12-0da9d8b1e752", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "20", "file_name": "10_Tools_for_Managing_Stress_&_Anxiety_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_10.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f3174556-50e4-4a2b-b331-99db90e6bd28", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "20", "file_name": "10_Tools_for_Managing_Stress_&_Anxiety_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_10.pdf"}, "hash": "9ddcc7a5b64e5d2638e06a32d23229415625bb2b640991b227f7d0c940495923", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b709bc8d-e7b7-4f76-86b6-d596cfa95f78", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "10_Tools_for_Managing_Stress_&_Anxiety_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_10.pdf"}, "hash": "c9c6ceaf860cecaa0564939e1f69ba9a9029e79133ea5543bc887e9dd8bdd77c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "cecd310c-94f7-4156-b1da-2209b5e9ec79", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8fa795ade732b1bc8ec770872fd5360c08e136702c02bd07f26a1857cfe2b388", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "973a6bec29643464e3486b72f7896e1a58bb6a9a2de987ea5b5b1ff428d2ff79", "text": "Transcribed by readthatpodcast.com  \nyou to focus.

And that all makes sense when you think about that the fact \nthat famine, thirst, bacterial infections, viral infections, invaders, all of this stuff liberates \na response in the body that's designed to get you to fight back against whatever stressor \nthat happens to be. Psychological, physical, bacterial, viral. Again, the stress response is \ngeneric.  \n \n00:45:32 Adrenalin (Epinephrine) Deploys Killer Immune Cells   \n \nThe tool takes advantage of the fact that when adrenaline is released in the body from \nthe adrenals, it has the effect of also liberating a lot of these killer cells from the immune \norgans, in particular from the spleen, but from elsewhere as well, and interactions with \nthe lymphatic system that combat infection. The way this works in the rea l world is best \ncaptured by a study that can be mapped back to so -called Wim Hof breathing. Now, \nWim Hof breathing is so named after the so -called \"Iceman,\" Wim Hof. Wim Hof, of \ncourse, being this Dutch. He, I think he has self -titled Daredevil. And indeed  he has \nmany, many Guinness Book of World Records for things like swimming under icebergs \nand going up Kilimanjaro in his shorts and crossing the desert without water, et cetera. \nThings that are quite dangerous if you don't know what you're doing. And Wim obviously \nsurvived or I'm telling you he survived. But there are two components to a sort of \nbreathing protocol  \n \n00:46:40 Cyclic Deep Breathing IS Stress: Wim Hof, Tummo & Super -Oxygenation   \n \nthat he developed that was based also on what's called Tummo b reathing, T -U-M-M-O. \nSo, before Wim, there was Tummo breathing. And many people call this now super \noxygenation breathing. Although the breath work aficionados will probably say, well, it's \nnot super oxygenation because you're also blowing an awful lot of carbon dioxide. What \nI'm talking about here, regardless of whether or not it's called Wim Hof, Tummo, or super \noxygenation, is rapid deliberate breathing. So, it's deliberate hyperventilation. Why would \nsomebody want to do this? Well, deliberate hyperventi lation done for maybe 25 cycles.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2531, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cecd310c-94f7-4156-b1da-2209b5e9ec79": {"__data__": {"id_": "cecd310c-94f7-4156-b1da-2209b5e9ec79", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "21", "file_name": "10_Tools_for_Managing_Stress_&_Anxiety_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_10.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "df44d55d-0493-4c92-b4e9-8fb854c6333e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "21", "file_name": "10_Tools_for_Managing_Stress_&_Anxiety_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_10.pdf"}, "hash": "f29c9aafe6a977264e47b9140fd54bc4f7f0eb3a1e5b595cac4e03e03511594e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9774a63f-e4c2-4a90-ad12-0da9d8b1e752", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "20", "file_name": "10_Tools_for_Managing_Stress_&_Anxiety_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_10.pdf"}, "hash": "973a6bec29643464e3486b72f7896e1a58bb6a9a2de987ea5b5b1ff428d2ff79", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5e0e9581-4d25-4946-a48f-7a68c91cda2a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "dce2b478f3d2de8889858f290f48078ccc1fa0bf504309220fdbf28149c40560", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "8fa795ade732b1bc8ec770872fd5360c08e136702c02bd07f26a1857cfe2b388", "text": "Transcribed by readthatpodcast.com  \nSo inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale. Typically, it's done in through the nose \nout through the mouth. Although sometimes it's just through the mouth. If you do that for \n15 breaths, 20 breaths, 25 breaths, you w ill feel very alert. People who have anxiety will \nfeel anxious. They might even have an anxiety attack. However, we need to ask why \nthat kind of breathing feels that way. And it's because that pattern of breathing, rapid \nmovements of the diaphragm will lib erate adrenaline from the adrenals. So, it's the \nrelease of adrenaline. I mentioned that Wim is also called \"The Iceman.\" Well, that's \nbecause he actually discovered this pattern of breathing, somewhat. And again, it maps \nback to Tummo breathing by going i nto cold water. When you go into cold water, that too \nis a stressor and you liberate adrenaline in response to cold water. So, if you get into an \nice bath or a cold shower, you will immediately release adrenaline from your adrenals. \nNow, there are all sort s of things related to this about psychological control and stress \nthresholds that we'll talk about, but I really want people to understand that when \nadrenaline is released in the body, you are in a better position to combat infections. And \nso, whether or not you breathe very quickly in these cycles of 25 breaths and regardless \nof what you call it, doesn't matter, adrenaline is released. If you take a cold shower, \nadrenaline is released. If you go into an ice bath deliberately, and even if you do it non -\ndeliberately, adrenaline is released. You are mimicking the stress response. And that \nadrenaline serves to suppress or combat incoming infections. And this was beautifully \nshown in a study that was published in a very fine journal, the \"Proceedings of the \nNational Academy of Sciences for the US.\" It's literally called \"Proceedings of the \nNational Academy of USA\" to distinguish it from other proceedings of other national \nacademies in other countries. The way the experiment went is that people were injected \nwith endotoxin or in some cases they were injected with a bacterial wall that mimics \ninfection. It gives you a fever. It makes you feel nauseous. It makes you feel sick. It is \nnot pleasant. Half of the people did a particular pattern of breathing that looked v ery \nmuch like the pattern of breathing I described a moment ago of doing 25 deep inhales \nand exhales followed by an exhale holding their breath. Then repeating 25 inhales, \nexhales holding their breath. So, this would look something like this, or if you're listening, \nit sounds like [inhaling and exhaling]. 25, 30 times, you'll start feeling heated up. You'll \nstart feeling the adrenaline response. You're liberating adrenaline in your body. Then \nexhale, hold your breath for 15 seconds and then repeat. And then  typically, after doing \nthree or four rounds of that, they would inhale very deeply and hold their breath. Now, I \nwant to emphasize never ever, ever do this anywhere near water.

In fact, were you to cut yourself very deeply while \nout on a hike in the woods, the other thing that would happen is that there would be a \nrapid inflammation response. And we always hear inflammation is bad. Inflammation \ngives us Alzheimer's. Inflammation is the worst thing. But the swelling is associated, the \ninflammati on is associated with the recruitment of things like macrophages or microglia if \nit's a neural tissue.

And indeed the inflammation response looks \nhorrible, it sounds horrible, but it's a great thing in the short -term.

A lot of stress inoculation, a lot of managing medium -\nterm stress on t he timescale of weeks or maybe even a couple months, so we're not \ntalking about years of stress, a lot of that has to do with raising our stress threshold. It's \nabout capacity. And there are very simple tools, excellent tools that will allow us to \nmodulate  our capacity for stress. And they look a lot like the tools I just described. They \ninvolve placing oneself deliberately into a situation where our adrenaline is increased \nsomewhat not to the extreme. And then when we feel flooded with adrenaline, and \nnorm ally we would panic, it's about cognitively, mentally, emotionally calming ourselves \nand being comfortable with that response in our body. So, unlike trying to unify the mind \nand body and make it all calm or make it all alert, this is about dissociating mi nd and \nbody in a healthy way. And what would this look like? Well, this is something I actually \ndo as a practice because I mentioned before, you can use physiological sighs in real \ntime, you can use the cyclic hyperoxygenation breathing to combat infection  if you're \nfeeling kind of run down. And there's also a way in which you can use things like cold \nshowers, or if you exercise and you bring your heart rate up very high, you kind of go \ninto that high -intensity realm where your heart is beating a little bit  harder than you're \ncomfortable with and that you're just you feel, some people think it's lactic acid. No one \ncan agree on this what the burn is, whether or not it's lactic acids or it's buildup of \nhydrogen or whatever. I don't want to get into that, but we're all familiar with the intense \nfeeling of your muscles kind of burning because you're working very hard physically. The \nkey in those moments is to learn to relax the mind while the body is very activated. And \nwhat that tends to do, there's a limited a mount of research on this, but what that tends to \ndo is it tends to create a situation where what once felt like a lot feels manageable. \nOkay?

And then what \nyou want to do is you want to actually try and calm the mind while your body is in this \nheightened state of activation. And the best way that I'm aware to do that,  \n \n00:59:50 Use Vision to Calm the Mind When the Body Is Agitated  \n \nagain goes back to physiology, not psychology. When we are stressed, our pupils dilate. \nThe effect of that pupil dilation is to create tunnel vision. It literally narrows our view of \nthe visual world. We no long er see in Panorama. And there's some other effects as well. \nBut that's because the visual system through this cranial nerve system that I described \nbefore is tethered and is part of this autonomic nervous system. By deliberately dilating \nyour gaze, meaning  not moving your head and eyes around, but by deliberately going \nfrom tunnel vision to broader panoramic vision, literally seeing more of your environment \nall at once. You don't have to do what I'm doing, which is not blinking. You're welcome to \nblink. But  it means deliberately dilating your gaze so that you can see yourself in the \nenvironment you're in. It creates a calming effect on the mind because it releases a \nparticular circuit in the brainstem that's associated with alertness, aka stress. Now, this i s \nvery powerful. If you're running, for instance, and you're at max capacity or close to it, or \nyou're kind of hitting like 80, 90% of maximum on the bike and you dilate your gaze, \nwhat you'll find is the mind can relax while the body is in full output. An d this relates to \nwork that in various communities, people are working with this in the sports community, \nmilitary community, et cetera. But it's a form, not really of stress inoculation, it's more \nabout raising stress threshold so that the body is going t o continue to be in a high \nalertness, high reactivity mode, high output, but the mind is calm. And so, this isn't about \nunifying mind and body. This is actually about using body to bring up your level of \nactivation, then dissociating, not the clinical diss ociation kind of disorders, but \ndissociating the mental or emotional response from what's going on in your body. And \nover time, so if you do this a couple of times, you don't have to do this every workout, but \nif you do this every maybe once a week or so, you start being comfortable at these \nhigher activation states. What once felt overwhelming and like a lot of work, now is \nmanageable. It feels tolerable. So, that's for navigating medium -term stress.

Okay, so let's talk about long -term stress. Earlier, I talked about how \nbreathing can modulate heart rate  through this loop that includes the brain and the \nparasympathetic nervous system. I don't think I mentioned this, and I want to make sure \nthat I mentioned that breathing controlling heart rate through the sympathetic and \nparasympathetic nervous system is the basis of what's called HRV, heart rate variability. \nAnd we know that heart rate variability is good. You don't want your heart rate \nchronically elevated or chronically low. A lot of people think, \"Oh, I want a really nice low \nheart rate.\" And indeed, i f you're in shape, the stroke volume of your heart will be greater \nand you can have a nice slow heart rate. Years ago when I was running regularly, I think \nmy heart rate was down to like 50 or 60 or something like that. That's great. But, and \nnow it's high er than that because I'm running a little bit less. But everyone needs to \ndetermine what's right for them. But you don't really want your heart rate to be \nchronically low or chronically high. Both are bad. We know that chronic stress, elevated \nstress and e specially in the so -called type A personalities creates heart disease, the \nleading killer of for in most, every country, but in particular in the US. Because of the way \nthat adrenaline impacts those blood vessels or constricting some and dilating others, i t's \njust that kind of hypertension, chronic hypertension is just bad. And so, chronic stress \ntruly is bad. I want to really make that clear because I emphasized a lot of what some of \nthe positive effects of stress. But you want to be able to tamp down your  stress in real \ntime.

At very high \nlevels, it makes u s feel blissed and it tends to make us feel like we have enough in our \nimmediate environment.

But \nthe side effec ts associated with drugs that increase serotonin tend to be reduced affect. \nThey tend to kind of blunt affect or make people feel like their libido is lower.

Not emotional darkness. But light suppresses melatonin. Melatonin helps you fall \nasleep. It doesn't help you stay asleep. I personally do not recommend supplementing \nmelatonin because it's supplemented typically at very high levels . One to three \nmilligrams or even more that is an outrageously high dose. It's super, super physiological \ncompared to what you normally would make. It also has a number of potentially negative \neffects on the reproductive access and hormones there. Some peo ple can take it without \nproblems. If you like it and that's your thing, fine. I just want to cue to the fact that there \ncan be issues. You should check on examine.com.

Now, a note about adrenal burnout. There \nis actually no such thing as adrenal burnout under norm al conditions. The adrenals have \nenough adrenaline to support 200 years of stress for better, for worse. The concept of \nadrenal burnout has origins in the work of Nobel Prize winner, Hans Selye, who actually \ndiscovered what he called the general adaptation  syndrome. He discovered a lot of \nthings about stress. He did some phenomenal work that turned out to be true. That we \nhave stressors. There's something called distress. He talked about eustress, which is \npositive stress. Eustress has never really caught o n in the kind of more general \ndiscussion. But he had this theory that if stress went on long enough, that you would \neventually reach a phase called exhaustion. And that turned out to be wrong. Although \nmany of you may feel exhausted after chronic stress, t here isn't really a physiological \nexhaustion that happens. And that eventually got picked up and ran with the general \npublic. And they talk about adrenal burnout. Too much coffee, adrenal burnout. You hear \nall this stuff. There is no such thing as adrenal burnout. The adrenals don't burn out. \nThere is something, however, called adrenal insufficiency syndrome, which is a real \nphysiological problem where some people have very impaired adrenals and they can't \nproduce adrenaline. And melatonin taken at very hig h levels for periods of time that are \ntoo long can cause suppression of the cortisol and epinephrine released from the \nadrenals and can create a kind of pseudo adrenal insufficiency syndrome. So, be aware \nof melatonin for that reason. Please, I'm trying, I  alone can't get rid of the phrase adrenal \nburnout. I'm not trying to give a hard time to anyone who feels burnt out or exhausted, \nbut it is for other reasons. It is not because of the adrenals are burnt out. Unless you \nhappen to have adrenal insufficiency  syndrome. So, I'm not a fan of melatonin for a lot of \nreasons. Now I've mentioned several.  \n \n01:21:10 L -Theanine For Stress Reduction and Task Completion Anxiety  \n \nThe other is L -theanine.

That's a healthy, \nbrief cortisol bump that goes away provided you're getting your light at the right time of \ndays at correct tim es of day, like morning and evening. But you don't want cortisol \nchronically elevated. That's associated with all the bad stuff about stress. There's a very \nstrong effect of ashwagandha. You can find dosages at examine.com. They report in \nacross six studie s, 14.5 to 27.9 reduction in cortisol in otherwise healthy, but stressed \nindividuals. Now, I don't know about kids. You have to look at what it says on various \nsupplements. Most things here are being done in adults. So, please check carefully. But \nthis is great. I mean, the opportunity for me anyway, to be able to take something that \ncan help me reduce my cortisol so that I don't get some of the long -term effects of \nstress. And I'm not going to take ashwagandha year round. I would only do this if I was \nfeeling like I wasn't managing my short and medium -term stress well. So, I don't take it \non a regular basis. I do take it when I'm in these times when things are particularly \nstressful. It has their five other studies that show reduced stress. So, that's not c ortisol \nmeasurements, but things like fatigue, cognitive impairment, et cetera. It does lower total \ncholesterol, which may or may not be good or bad for you up to 10%. So, some people \ndon't want their cholesterol lowered. Some people might. Cholesterol, we 'll talk about \nthis in a month on hormones, but cholesterol is the molecule from which testosterone \nand estrogen and cortisol for that matter are synthesized. So, you don't want to get your \ncholesterol so low, then there are all sorts of negative effects, but you don't want it too \nhigh either. Mild effects in good clinical studies on reducing depression, probably \nassociated with the effects on stress and some other things as well. So, ashwagandha is \nsomething I use from time to time.

It was very important that we discuss \nstress and we discuss in the context of short, medium, and long -term stress. That we \ndiscuss tools for short -term, medium -term, and long -term control. I don't really want to \nsay mitigation of stress. Stress is going to happen. But our ability to modulate and \ncontrol stress in real time offline using tools such as respiration, using tools such as \ndilation of gaze, using tools like social connection, maybe some supplements, certainly \ntake care of your sleep and nutrition and exercise. Again, tons of resources and \ninformation in the sleep episodes. So, you can look there. We will do a month on \nhormones, on exercise, et cetera. Bu t let's talk about emotions because in subsequent \nepisodes, we're going to talk about OCD, we're going to talk about depression, we're \ngoing to talk about mania, we're going to be talking about dopamine and all sorts of \nthings. But at the core of emotions is this question, what is an emotion? Well, it's \ncomplex. There isn't a single brain area for any one of these things that we call \nemotions. My framework, and I think the modern science, both psychology and \nneuroscience is pretty well -aligned with what Lis a Feldman Barrett has taught about. \nNow, Lisa's at Northeastern University. She runs a big lab there. She's a world expert in \nemotion. She's written two books that are really wonderful. One is \"How Emotions Are \nMade,\" which was her first book. The second o ne is \"Seven and a Half Facts About the \nBrain.\" It's a wonderful book as well. It came out more recently. I hosted Lisa on an \nInstagram live once. Maybe we'll get her here on the podcast if we're lucky. We don't \nagree on everything about the neuroscience o f emotions, but I subscribed to most \neverything that I've heard Lisa say. In particular, the fact that emotions are context -\ndependent. There's a cultural dependence, et cetera. I look at things mainly through the \nlens of physiology and neuroscience and kin d of low -level circuitry. And one way to think \nabout emotions that I think is consistent and I think Lisa would generally approve, I can't \nspeak for her, but I would hope she would generally approve of this description, is that", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2730, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d85761a2-78a5-45dc-bde8-ca9c0d603742": {"__data__": {"id_": "d85761a2-78a5-45dc-bde8-ca9c0d603742", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "38", "file_name": "10_Tools_for_Managing_Stress_&_Anxiety_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_10.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6382db0f-9baa-4599-897b-8592485fc5f3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "38", "file_name": "10_Tools_for_Managing_Stress_&_Anxiety_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_10.pdf"}, "hash": "481d63219ad6c712b5cb42bd4f1619b26fb857626c23d853c96bdd901b404233", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "25cf125a-af9e-4e87-aa4d-3b2d5b95379f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "37", "file_name": "10_Tools_for_Managing_Stress_&_Anxiety_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_10.pdf"}, "hash": "4e7636222f90f0442046e283b6153d4008ae123a49cb8874147036104d8cc699", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "64e97930-f7a7-41da-89fd-a80435f4f3b6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8789d19a6340608a3df8a535aea461ef7224a6a248b7bd6feee72ecd0d4989d4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "6df67a76c337f19928dc6671d8ae0bb04cc7316ca82dd421503088f98f8e7bdb", "text": "Transcribed by readthatpodcast.com  \nwhen our internal state of s tress or calm matches the demands on us or is mismatched \nfrom the demands on us, we tend to interpret those as good or bad. Let me give you an \nexample. If I am feeling very anxious, very stressed inside, and I have a lot to do, that \ndoesn't feel good, but it's really no different than if I'm very tired and I have a lot to do \nbecause there's this mismatch. I'm not in the right internal state, my internal state is \nincorrect rather, to meet the demands that are being placed upon me. So, in both cases, \nwhether I'm too tired or I'm too stressed to do what I need to do, the valence, meaning \nthe value that I assigned to that is I don't feel good. It's not a good situation and I don't \nfeel good. Now, I might call it stressed, I might call it anxious, I might call it  worried, I \nmight call it a number of things, but it's not good. However, when I'm tired and I want to \nfall asleep, well then I feel good because that's what the demand is. I need to go to sleep \nand I'm tired. If I'm wide awake and I need to fall asleep, t hen that's not good. And then \nthe brain tends to go down the direction of interpreting the situation as a bad one. So, \nwhile the discussion around emotions is far more nuanced and more elaborate than this, \none way to think about your relationship to emotio ns is whether or not your internal state \nis matching the demands that are upon you. So, in that way, we don't really place so \nmuch value on whether or not we're feeling alert or sleepy. We only place value on \nwhether or not that alertness whether or not it 's full -blown stress or not or our sleepiness, \nwhether or not we're falling asleep or just a little bit drowsy, whether or not that matches \nthe conditions that we face. And it's a useful framework to have. And it's the reason in \npart why I spent this last hour and a half or so talking about stress and how to control \nstress. One reason we did that is because I think it's a valuable opportunity to learn \nsome tools and understand stress and really learn how to take control of stress, which I \nthink we could all  benefit from doing regardless of age. The other reason is that when \nyou start to understand that you have this kind of see -saw system in your body, this \nautonomic nervous system that takes you from alert and calm to stressed to full -blown \npanic, it has th at capacity, or from sleepy and drowsy to passing out tired to God forbid, \nlet's hope never, but a coma, right? That you're basically on this see -saw all the time. \nAnd where you are on that see -saw of alertness or calmness positions you to be in \nbetter rea ction to the demands that you face. Whether or not the thing that you face is a \nneed to fall asleep or to listen quietly and not react. You now know, for instance, that if \nyour job is to take feedback, when maybe you're going in for a job evaluation or you 're in \na relationship where there was a call for a discussion and somebody needs to talk to you \nabout something and we need to talk about something, you're going to there you're like,", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3111, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "64e97930-f7a7-41da-89fd-a80435f4f3b6": {"__data__": {"id_": "64e97930-f7a7-41da-89fd-a80435f4f3b6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "39", "file_name": "10_Tools_for_Managing_Stress_&_Anxiety_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_10.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "16261e59-c513-488a-be66-99e2e6691d0f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "39", "file_name": "10_Tools_for_Managing_Stress_&_Anxiety_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_10.pdf"}, "hash": "7256e227253af2df6fe5dd6b0f8fe829cac7f6bccbd32a75523ae066c549f8ff", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d85761a2-78a5-45dc-bde8-ca9c0d603742", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "38", "file_name": "10_Tools_for_Managing_Stress_&_Anxiety_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_10.pdf"}, "hash": "6df67a76c337f19928dc6671d8ae0bb04cc7316ca82dd421503088f98f8e7bdb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "31c47bf2-79bd-4f1f-9f5d-6e1a00cddd63", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "cb67f7f703dc21994d702a00d5b74295f8a1c5345f96b76f1f966f8088acffd0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "8789d19a6340608a3df8a535aea461ef7224a6a248b7bd6feee72ecd0d4989d4", "text": "Transcribed by readthatpodcast.com  \n\"Goodness, this is going to be rough.\" Learning to reduce that stress re sponse a little bit \nso that you are in a position to hear the information better, and remember, from a \nprevious episode, if you close your eyes, you'll be able to actually focus on the \ninformation better.

You will  be able to react to things in a more effective way and to \nnot be reactive. And this is really one of the important things to me anyway, is that so \nmuch of the language around psychology, which I think is a wonderful field, but pop \npsychology in particular  is be responsive, not reactive. Well, great. But then how does \none do that? Well, one does that by modulating their short -term stress response in real \ntime. Not by saying, \"Hold on, I need to meditate. Hold on, I need a massage and then I \ncan have this co nversation.\" By modulating the reactivity in real time. How does one, for \ninstance, be mindful? Which is a beautiful concept, but how are you mindful? Well, I \ndon't know, when I'm moving through my day, a lot of times I'm just trying to get things \ndone. An d as soon as I start monitoring and seeing what I'm doing and kind of third -\npersoning what I'm doing, it actually takes me out of the effectiveness and experience of \nwhat I'm doing. So for me, sometimes that mindfulness, that observer, as they call it, is \nsomething that doesn't help me. It actually hinders me. What's important to me is to be \nable to work and focus and then to be able to disengage. To be able to do a non -sleep \ndepressed or to be able to still fall asleep even though I've been working hard un til 9:30 \nto put my head down at 10 o'clock and be out cold sleeping by 10:02.

And so, rather than take  a subjective view of this, I \ntake the view of objective physiology. What can we do that's anchored to these neuronal \nsystems in our body, in our brain, in our eyes, in our diaphragm, et cetera, and look to \nthose as tools leavers that we can pull on and pu sh and maneuver through life in a way \nwhere we start to feel like we have some agency.
