Podcast #55  \nIn this episode, I discuss the science of setting, assessing, and pursuing goals. I explain \nthe neural (brain) circuits that underlie goal setting and pursuit. Then I describe nine \nscience -supported tools anyone can apply toward their goals. I explain when and how to \nuse goal visualization, when to use multitasking and how to use specific rewards to \nimprove the likelihood of reaching your goals. I also explain why envisioning failure s and \ntheir consequences are effective and how to set goals of the appropriate level of \nchallenge. I also explain how the molecule dopamine is used to gauge our progress \ntoward milestones and long -term overarching goals and how to leverage dopamine for \ngoal pursuit. Finally, I explain a unique tool called 'space -time bridging' that can be used \nto support all aspects of goal setting, assessment, and pursuit.

I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a Professor of Neurobiology and \nOphthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, we're talking all  about goals and \nthe science of goal setting and achieving your goals. There's a tremendous amount of \ninformation on the internet and in books and so forth, about how to set goals and assess \nyour progress towards goals and update your goals and so forth. I n fact, there are so \nmany programs out there, that includes so many different acronyms that it can be a little \nbit overwhelming. Today's conversation about goals, is going to be quite a bit different. \nIndeed, we are going to talk about setting goals. We ar e also going to talk about how to \nassess progress towards goals. And we are going to talk about goal execution. \nHowever, we're going to do all of this in the context of neuroscience, because it turns out \nthat there are not hundreds or dozens or even severa l neural circuits in your brain, that \ncontrol goal setting and movement toward your goals. There is one and while it includes \nmany different brain areas, that one circuit is the same circuit, that's responsible for \npursuing all goals. And it relates to som e very basic neurochemical mechanisms that are \nunderstood. So while there's a wealth of information out there about goals and goal \nsetting and goal achievement and so forth, there's comparatively little information that's \nbeen available to the public about  the neuroscience of goal setting and goal \nachievement. So that's what we're going to focus on today. I promise that we're going to \nget into the neuroscience, we're going to touch on a little bit of the psychology and how \nthe neuroscience relates to what's  known in the psychology literature. And we are going \nto establish several, in fact, four specific protocols that you can use for goal setting,  \n \n00:01:56 Tool 1: Learn Fast(er) by the 85% Rule  \n \ngoal assessment and goal execution in an ongoing basis, rega rdless of what your", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2610, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "433a6da6-6ff3-4e74-b27b-a48a2b4d8998": {"__data__": {"id_": "433a6da6-6ff3-4e74-b27b-a48a2b4d8998", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "55_The_Science_of_Setting_&_Achieving_Goals_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_55.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "25d48a1f-ebf4-4e24-b3c0-51e0147f78e8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "55_The_Science_of_Setting_&_Achieving_Goals_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_55.pdf"}, "hash": "05f9a90c7d3316eb030a1ef8b5b9a6664ec8620109fc5a6361ee890a29105802", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "530750dd-221d-4587-aa8b-cbf5a6387590", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "55_The_Science_of_Setting_&_Achieving_Goals_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_55.pdf"}, "hash": "e2973d0010ba9db821e91101afdad1a7cbfd3e08b1346bf773d0eeb9feacacf1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "bebee53f-6339-456b-9250-dd018b3e8a5a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "948dbefe2f5dceb1bc8fa98e6b2a6212548deebcd50d5be28a5207f20e1500c9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "26225bad447cd49c795ee06a727cbd75b90f20050ca4bb7e952da02be7ba919b", "text": "Transcribed by readthatpodcast.com  \npersonal goals happen to be. Before we dive into our conversation about goals and goal \nsetting and goal achievement, I'd like to highlight some recent scientific findings, that I \nthink are going to be interesting and actionable for many  of you out there. In earlier \npodcasts, we talked about neuro -plasticity, which is the brain's ability to change in \nresponse to experience. In fact, neuroplasticity underlies all forms of learning, whether or \nnot it's language learning or learning music or  math or a physical skill, all forms of \nlearning involve the reorganization of connections in the nervous system, the brain and \nspinal cord and body. One of the key principles of neuroplasticity, is this notion of \nmaking errors as a good thing toward neuro plasticity. It is a little bit counterintuitive, but \nwhat the scientific literature tells us, is that whenever we're trying to learn something \nnew, if we make an error, we know it feels frustrating, but that state of frustration, \nactually queues up particu lar brain areas to be more alert, so that on subsequent \nattempts to learn that thing, we have a heightened level of focus and a higher probability \nof learning the new skill, regardless of what that skill is. And I've talked about this before \nin various epi sodes, as encouraging people to embrace errors or pursue errors, not as \ntheir own end goal, but errors as an entry point for making the brain more plastic. And if \nyou think about it really makes sense, why would the brain change at all, if it's \nperforming everything perfectly? When you make errors, well in the immediate seconds \nand minutes after those errors, you are in a better position to learn. A common question I \nget, however, is what should be the rate of errors? Which is really just a way of saying, \nhow hard should the given task be that you're trying to learn or perform? And it turns out \nthere's an answer. There's a recent paper that was published in a great journal, \"Nature \nCommunications\". This is a paper, our last author, Jonathan Cohen, and the pa per is \nentitled, \"The Eighty Five Percent Rule for optimal learning\". This paper, we will make \navailable by a link in the show note captions, but basically what this paper shows, is that \nwhen trying to learn something new, you want to make the difficulty o f what you're trying \nto learn, such that, you are getting things right about 85% of the time. That you're \nmaking errors about 15% of the time. And the reason I like this paper, is it really points \nspecifically to some protocols that we can implement becaus e people always say, okay, \nyou want to set a high goal. You want to try and achieve something that's really lofty, but \nyou don't want to make the goal so lofty that you don't make any progress at all. Other \npeople say, you really want to start with really small goals and make things very, very \nincremental. Only set out to do things that you know you can accomplish and that will \nfeed back on your self -esteem and all these positive feedback loops. And then, you", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3083, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bebee53f-6339-456b-9250-dd018b3e8a5a": {"__data__": {"id_": "bebee53f-6339-456b-9250-dd018b3e8a5a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "55_The_Science_of_Setting_&_Achieving_Goals_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_55.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "670ed572-8bcb-4f1b-91ed-2ce5242be1f4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "55_The_Science_of_Setting_&_Achieving_Goals_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_55.pdf"}, "hash": "3398adda197da85697a0093f4ab02d650d0d881cdc1738bbe5aefdf4ffe362af", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "433a6da6-6ff3-4e74-b27b-a48a2b4d8998", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "55_The_Science_of_Setting_&_Achieving_Goals_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_55.pdf"}, "hash": "26225bad447cd49c795ee06a727cbd75b90f20050ca4bb7e952da02be7ba919b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2d671510-37c7-4f4f-8b64-7c3872f68872", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d04f6c75e119aad7df90798406614ebab7d8cc45e5d15cc65b433f16b2fed2f7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "948dbefe2f5dceb1bc8fa98e6b2a6212548deebcd50d5be28a5207f20e1500c9", "text": "Transcribed by readthatpodcast.com  \nknow, layer by layer, layer by layer, you'll eve ntually get where you want to go. Well, it \nturns out that neither is true you need to set the level of difficulty, such that you're \nmaking errors about 15% of the time. And I want to emphasize about 15% of the time, \nbecause there's no way to figure protoco ls for sport or language or math or anything \nelse, where you're going to have exactly 15% errors. So, anyway, this paper, the 85% \nrule for optimal learning, again, we will supply the link, but it really points to the idea of \nmaking things pretty hard, but not so hard that you're failing every attempt or even half of \nthe attempts. Failing about 15% of the time seems optimal for learning. Hopefully that \ninformation will be useful to any of you that are trying to learn something. Hopefully it will \nalso be usef ul to those of you that are teaching kids or other adults. If you're teaching, \nkeep in mind that you want to keep the students reaching for higher and higher levels of \nproficiency in whatever that is that you're teaching. And that 15% of the time they shou ld \nbe failing, if it gets to 20%, that's probably okay. If they start failing about half the time, \nthen probably what they're trying to learn is too difficult for them at that point. Now, of \ncourse, this is going to be controlled by all sorts of external f actors, like whether or not \nthey slept well the night before, whether or not you slept well the night before and you're \nbeing clear in your instructions to them, et cetera.

Before we \nbegin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast, is separate from my teaching and research \nroles at Stanford.

In fact, \nneurons, nerve cells, function because salt, sodium actually enters those cells quickly \nand that's what causes them to fire action potentials. The commo n syllable or a \nlanguage of neurons, if you will, when we are low in sodium, our neurons don't work as \nwell. And a few years later, I had the experience of feeling kind of shaky and I thought I \nhad blood sugar issues. I went and got my blood sugar checked and it was fine. And a \nphysician made the recommendation, that I actually up my salt intake. My intake wasn't \nparticularly low, I didn't think, but I quickly found, was that if I consumed enough salt, \nusually I would do this in the form of putting a little  pinch of salt into some water, adding \na little lemon juice or something like that, or salting my food a little bit more. That I lost \nany kind of shakiness in my hands, that my mental functioning was better, my sports \nperformance was better, et cetera. So it was really interesting to see that shift simply by \nincreasing my salt intake, something that's really counterintuitive, to a lot of what's out \nthere. Salt isn't just important for the function of neurons, it's important for blood volume \nand working alon gside the other electrolytes, magnesium and potassium, it ensures that \ncells in our body function properly. And I think we're starting to see a shift out there now, \nin the perception of what salt and the other electrolytes do. And really seeing \nmagnesium, which is one of the electrolytes, potassium and especially salt, as not \nnecessarily something to avoid, but in fact something to embrace, provided that they're \nused properly. LMNT is formulated to help anyone, reach their electrolyte needs and is \nparticula rly well -suited to people following a keto, low carb or paleo diet. For people \nfollowing a low carb diet or doing intermittent fasting, what many people don't know, is \nthat carbohydrate holds water. It actually brings water into the system and you don't \nwant your system to be low on water, that's one form of dehydration.. Salt holds water as \nwell, meaning it keeps the water in your system, which is beneficial for brain and body \nfunction. LMNT contains a science -backed electrolyte ratio of 1000 milligrams, t hat's one \ngram of sodium, 200 milligrams of potassium and 60 milligrams of magnesium. And they \nuse the very best forms of salt, potassium, and magnesium that are out there. So the \nway I use LMNT, is I usually will mix up one packet into about 16 to 30 ounc es of water \nin the morning and drink that first thing in the morning when I wake up or around \nbreakfast time, doesn't really matter. I kind of sip on it through the morning or if I'm really \nthirsty, I'll drink it all at once. And then I always make sure to  drink a volume of water \nwith an LMNT packet in it, somewhere around my exercise.

The reason I started \ntaking Athletic Greens and the reason I sti ll take Athletic Greens, is that it covers all of \nmy foundational vitamin, mineral, probiotic needs. We of course need vitamins. We of \ncourse need minerals and we do need a healthy gut microbiome and probiotics, support \na healthy gut microbiome. There is n ow a wealth of quality scientific published data, \nshowing that the microbiota, meaning the little microbes that live in our gut, are good for \nus. And our gut when it functions properly, communicates with our brain and our brain \ncommunicates with our gut th rough the so -called, gut -brain axis. And that gut -brain axis, \nis vital for things like immune system, endocrine system, meaning hormones and for \nmood and overall brain function. With Athletic Greens, I get my vitamins, my minerals \nand the probiotics I need , to support a healthy gut microbiome and gut -brain axis without \nhaving to worry about taking a bunch of other things. In fact, when people ask me, \nwhat's the one supplement I should take, that's going to make me feel better? I always \nsay Athletic Greens b ecause indeed it makes me feel better and it happens to taste \nterrific. I drink it twice a day, typically, I'll have one in the morning, I mix it with water and \na little bit of lemon or lime juice. And I'll typically have it again in the afternoon or late \nafternoon, again, mixed with water, some lemon or lime juice.

And even if it's bright out or there are shadows or it's really dim \noutside, or it's getting dark, that your visual system can try and manage , to resolve \nwhat's out there in the world, so you can see things clearly.

Predators will have to hunt and kill \nand eat their food and they have to avoid getting injured in that process. They also have \nto raise young, et cetera. So humans are among the other animals, or we could say the \nanimals are among us in the need to set goals and to make efforts to achieve those \ngoals. Now, why do I emphasize  this commonality of process? The reason I emphasize \nthis commonality of process, is that it turns out that there is one basic system by which \nall animals, including humans, set and attempt to achieve goals. Now humans are \nunique in our ability to orient o ur mind toward immediate goals, moderately termed \ngoals, meaning things that might exist on the scale of a week or a month or even a year \nand very long -term goals, like a lifetime goal or a goal that lasts a decade, or it takes a \ndecade to achieve. That's what makes us unique. And of course we don't have access to \nthe mindset or the thinking or the emotions of other animals, but what we do know is \nthat, common neural circuits, meaning brain areas, that are present in animal species \nand in humans, are respon sible for orienting our thinking and our action toward particular \ngoals. Another thing that's really unique about the human brain, is that we are able to \nhave multiple goals interacting at once. So, for instance, we probably all have fitness \ngoals, goals i n relationships of different kinds, friendships, and romantic partnerships as \nwell as maybe scholastic goals. Maybe you're in school or you're pursuing some kind of \nlearning outside of the school environment or indoor, you have business goals or \nfinancial goals, we are able to have multiple goals at once. And other animals do this, \nbut humans are unique in the ability to juggle a lot of goals. And actually one of the \nmajor challenges in pursuing goals, is that goal pursuit often interacts, meaning if you \ncan spend 100% of your time chasing one particular goal, that might be very effective for \nthat goal, but then we tend to fall back on some of our other goals. You can imagine how \nthis plays out. If you're working very, very hard, you're solely focused on bus iness often, \nyour health will suffer. If you're solely focused on your health often, other things will \nsuffer. And so we have to juggle both our goal setting and our goal pursuits. And so \ntoday, we're going to talk about a number of different ways, to work  with what could very \nwell be called, these interleaving goals, by focusing on a common practice or common \nset of mechanisms that are present in all aspects of goal seeking. What is that process? \nWell, it turns out, it's a neural circuit. A neural circuit,  is simply a collection of brain areas, \nthat when active in a particular sequence give rise to a particular behavior or perception. \nSo for instance, when you feel happy, it's not because you have a brain area, that's the \nhappy brain area, that is electrica lly active.

In the same way, that the keys \non a piano, together, played in the appropriate sequence, represent a particular song. \nYou would never say that  one key on the piano represents that song, but that key is \nnecessary. Similarly, in the brain, we can say that a brain area might be necessary, but \nnot sufficient to give us a particular experience or generate a particular behavior. So \nwhen we think about  goal seeking and the pursuit of goals of any kind in the brain, it \ndoesn't matter what the goal is. It involves a common set of neural circuits and the \nneural circuit that I'd like to orient us toward today. And we will return to it a few times, \ninvolves learning a couple of names, but you don't have to worry so much about \nmemorizing these. Just more important is to understand the logic of how it's put together \nand I will explain that and make it very clear. If you want to learn the names, that's great. \nOne of the brain areas is the so -called, amygdala. The amygdala is most often \nassociated with fear, so you might say, wow, how is that involved in goal directed \nbehavior? Well, a lot of our goal directed behavior, is to avoid punishments, including \nthings li ke embarrassment or financial ruin or things of that sort. And so the amygdala \nand some sense of anxiety or fear, is actually built in to the circuits that generate goal \nseeking and our motivation to pursuit goals. The other areas are the so -called, ventra l \nstriatum. The striatum is part of what's called, the basal ganglia. The basal ganglia, is a \nneural circuit, that can very simply be described as a neural circuit that helps us \ngenerate go, meaning the initiation of action and no -go, the prevention of act ion type \nscenarios. Let me make that even simpler. The ventral striatum is part of this thing \ncalled, the basal ganglia. The basal ganglia has sort of two circuits within it. One circuit \nis involved in getting us to do things, like I'm going to get up tomo rrow and I'm going to \nrun five miles first thing in the morning. I don't know if I'm actually going to do that, but \nI'm just using that as an example. Another circuit within the basal ganglia, is a no -go \ncircuit, it's the one that says, no, I'm not going t o go for the second cookie or the third \ncookie. I'm not going to eat that. And then the go circuit would be the one that's \nresponsible for instead eating something else. Okay, so we have go and no -go circuits \nwithin the basal ganglia. So we've got amygdala , so what you think of as kind of fear and \nanxiety and avoidance. We've got, the basal ganglia, which are for initiating action and \npreventing action. And then there is the so -called, cortex. The cortex is the outer shell of \nthe brain, and there are two su b regions of the cortex, that are involved in goal -directed \nbehavior. One is the lateral prefrontal cortex, prefrontal cortex is involved in, so -called, \nexecutive function, things like planning.

And the so -\ncalled, orbitofrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex has a large number of functions, but one \nof the key functions of the orbitofrontal cortex, it's involved in meshing some emotionality \nwith our current state of progress and comparing that emotionality to where it might be, \nwhen we are closer to a goal. So, there are basically four areas, one involv ed in anxiety, \none involved in emotion, one involved in planning and another involved in this go, no -go \naction. So that's a bunch of detail, but if I wanted to make it really simple for everyone, I \nwould say there are four areas. One is an area associated with anxiety and fear, it's the \namygdala. The second is involved in action and inaction, remember go, and no -go, so \nthat's the basal ganglia. The other one is involved in planning and thinking across \ndifferent timescales, so that's lateral prefrontal corte x. And then the fourth one, is \ninvolved in emotionality, where we sit emotionally present, compared to where we think \nwe will be emotionally, when we reach some particular goal and that's the orbitofrontal \ncortex. Again, you don't need to know all those na mes. You don't need to know all the \ndetails, just understand that those different elements are involved in the decision -making \nprocesses that lead us toward particular goals and have us update our goal seeking, et \ncetera. One key thing is it doesn't matter  what the goal is, the same circuits are involved. \nSo whether or not you're trying to build a company, that's a billion dollar company that's \ngoing to go public, or you're thinking about planning a craft day at home with the kids or \nfor yourself, or you're  thinking about what movie to go see. Goals, goal seeking and \nassessing progress towards goals, all involve the exact same neural circuits. It's really \nremarkable.  \n \n00:21:52 Determining the Value of Goals  \n \nIt's also very convenient for our discussion tod ay. What's going on in these circuits, can \nbasically be boiled down to two particular things. The first is, value information, trying to \nunderstand whether or not, something is really worth pursuing or not. So, placing a value \non a particular goal. The oth er component of this neural circuit, is associated with action, \nwhich actions to take and which actions not to take, given the value of a particular goal \nin a given moments time. I want to say that again. The other component of the circuit is \ninvolved in a ction, whether or not you should act or should not act, based on your \nassessment of the value of a goal at a particular moment in time.

Here 's why, there is basically one neuro -transmitter or rather neuromodulator \nsystem, that governs our goal setting, goal assessment and goal pursuit. And that is the \nneuromodulator dopamine. Dopamine is the common currency by which we assess our \nprogress towa rd particular things of particular value. In fact, dopamine, is the way that \nwe assess value of our pursuits. And so, as we take a moment and we shift our \nattention, to the psychology of goal setting. The things that you've probably heard a bit \nmore about,  about what sorts of goals are good and how to set goals and how to \ncategorize goals. I want you to think about how dopamine, could possibly be involved in \nthese different processes. And the reason I want you to do this, is that all of the \npsychology of go al setting and goal pursuit, is wonderful because it places things into \ndifferent categories. It allows us to parse our thinking and organize our thinking. But \nwhat's not often seen, in fact, I'm not aware of any literature out there, scientific or \nliterat ure in the popular press or in popular books, is an understanding of how the \nunderlying neurobiology, can be layered on top of the psychology of goal setting, to \nallow us to set and pursue our goals more effectively. And that's what we're going to do \ntoday . We are eventually going to arrive at a set of four practices, that when performed \non a regular basis, will allow you to assess, what is the value of this next particular \naction step? How worthwhile is it, to do behavior A versus behavior B in order to ac hieve \na particular goal? If any of this is vague now, I'm going to make it all very clear for you. \nYou're going to come away with some very specific lists of takeaways that you can put \ndown on paper, if you like.

This is an enormous literature, meaning \nthere are tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of scientific papers about the \ntopic of goal setting and goal pursuit. There's also a lot of information on the internet \nabout goal pursuit. And in looking over this information, one comes to appreciate pretty \nquickly, that acronyms are a big thing.

But as I moved through this literature, \nI started to see some redundant themes. And so what I've attempted to do, is  distill out \nthe redundant themes, that regardless of the person teaching or the scientific laboratory \nthat happened to come up with these acronyms, that they boil down to some common \nfeatures. So let's talk about that literature and I think we'll come awa y with an \nunderstanding of some basic elements that are common to all goals. Now, the modern \nscience or the modern psychological science of trying to understand goal setting and \npursuit, actually dates back to the 1930s. And we have to be sure that members  of our \nspecies, were focused on goal setting and goal pursuit, long before the scientific \nliterature emerged. It just stands to reason that, since the human brain hasn't evolved \nthat much, we don't think, in the last 10,000 years, that people would be thi nking about \nthese things. They just didn't get them down into papers, that we could evaluate on \nPubMed and so forth, but now we can, so we can look at those papers. And what you \nfind is that acronyms are abound in the psychology literature about goal setti ng and goal \npursuit. So for instance, you'll hear about the work of Larkin Small, for instance, these \nare the last names of various researchers. The so -called, ABC method, that a goal \nshould be achievable, it should be believable, and that the person be co mmitted. It's sort \nof obvious once you hear about the ABC method. Then people came along and \nexpanded on that, they talked about the so -called, SMART method. SMART being \nanother acronym, that it be specific, that the goal be measurable, that the goal be \nattainable, that the goal be realistic and that it be time -bound, meaning that you set up \ncertain period of time in which a given goal should be performed. And then people come \nalong and modify these, this is the way that psychology research is done. I'm not  \nlaughing at it. I'm just chuckling because, it seems like the acronyms get longer and \nlonger and longer. They developed the, SMARTER approach, adding an ER to the \nacronym, SMART, S -M-A-R-T-E-R. They added ethical and rewarding, which \nfortunately, are good  things I believe, ethical and rewarding. What does all this mean? \nWell, what it means is that any kind of goal pursuit, any kind of goal setting, really has to \ninvolve a number of different states and neural circuits in the brain and body, at least \nthat's  how I view this literature. Why would I do that? Well, let's think about the very \nmodern version of the kind of acronyms that I talked about a moment ago, dating back to \nthe 1930s and extending into the 1990s. You can find beautiful talks online from peop le \nwho have worked with some of the biggest companies and greatest high performers out \nthere, to achieve incredible things.

They'll talk about goals needing to be significant . That it has to \nbe a big goal. That it has to be concrete, so you have to be able to describe what the \ngoal is. It has to be action -oriented, has to be inspirational, has to be time -bound. You \nhave to have reasonable, realistic, verifiable measures. You h ave to constantly up the \nante. If it's starting to sound repetitive, it's because it is repetitive. There are basically \nonly three or four elements, to goal setting and goal pursuit. Basically, an individual or \nset of individuals, has to identify a specifi c thing that they're going to attain. In some \ncommunities, they talk about, knowing what right looks like, meaning being able to \ndefine a very specific goal. You can't just say, I want to be a champion athlete. You have \nto say what sport, and you have to u nderstand what the path to that is. So any big goal \nof course, is broken up into a series of smaller goals, but the whole thing starts with \nthinking about the end in mind. And in a few minutes, we will talk about, whether or not \nvisualization of the end in  mind, is actually beneficial or detrimental to achieving goals. \nThere's actually great neuroscience and psychology data on that now. So, I mentioned \nall these acronyms, not as an attempt to disparage them. I think they're wonderful. And I \nmentioned all th at psychology literature, not in an attempt to disparage it, but rather just \nsay that, goal setting is the first step, assessment of whether or not one is making \nprogress towards those goals is the second but necessary step. And then there's the \nbusiness o f goal execution. And that brings us back to the neural circuit components, \nremember, this neural circuit, involving those four things earlier, the amygdala, striatum, \norbitofrontal cortex and the prefrontal cortex. They work together, to divide the whole \nprocess as I mentioned before, into two general categories. The first is, assessing value, \nknowing whether or not where one is at one given moment, relates to some external \nthing. Are things going well or things going poorly? And knowing how to gauge that \naccurately. And then, action steps, goes and no goes, do more of this, do less of that, do \nthis, don't do that, et cetera. So, now we are going to shift back to the neuroscience and \nwe're going to talk about the practical applications of the information I just described. \nBecause I've given you a lot of kind of academic information.

In fact, \nlet's start with a tool now because as we move through all this information, I want to \nmake sure that people are coming away with some prac tical things that they can \nimplement. And indeed, some things that you can even do during the course of listening \nto or watching this podcast. The first thing to do, is to understand the difference between \nperipersonal space and extra personal space. Perip ersonal space, is all the space, \nliterally, that's within inside your body, the surface of your skin and in your immediate \nenvironment. Peripersonal space, is a key concept in neuroscience because you have \nparticular neural circuits and particular chemical s, that are geared toward, what are \ncalled consummatory behaviors, meaning, using things and consuming things and \nenjoying things, that are in your immediate peripersonal space. Let me give you an \nexample of this for myself, just to make it concrete. You c an imagine similar examples \nfor yourself right now. Within my current peripersonal space, is my interoception, my \nunderstanding or perception of my internal body. So, how quickly I'm breathing, my heart \nrate, the feelings on the surface of my skin, et cete ra. But also, within the confines of my \nperipersonal space, is this coffee mug, that if you're listening to this, you can't see this, \nbut I'm lifting up a coffee mug, I'm going to take a sip of coffee. That's a consummatory \nbehavior, I have the coffee, I d on't have to do much or motivate much to get it. I have \nother things here, pens and computer, et cetera. So things in your peripersonal space \nand consuming those things, is generally governed by a set of neurochemicals, that \ncenter around the neuromodulato r serotonin. And there are a few others as well, things \nlike oxytocin, but mainly serotonin. Contrast that, with the so -called, extra personal \nspace. Extrapersonal space is everything beyond the confines of my reach. It would be \nsomething in the next room.  It will be something down the street. It will be something at \nsome other location, in space and time. And the neuromodulators and neurochemicals, \nthat are associated with any kind of thinking about, anything in the extra personal space, \nare distinct from the neurochemicals and neuromodulators, that are involved in thinking \nabout or making actions towards the peripersonal space. And the molecule that's most \nassociated with thinking about or orienting toward the extra personal space, again, \nthings beyond the  confines of my skin or your skin, is dopamine. And this is a vitally \nimportant concept to understand, when you're setting goals and seeking goals.

And our ability to understand what's out there in the extra personal \nspace and our ability to move into that extra personal space. And a simple way to \nconceive of all this, is that we evaluate our progress in the peripersonal space. We \nevaluate how we feel, about some pursuit, even if we haven't initiated that pursuit yet. \nHow we fee l about a particular goal, is truly a feeling that we experience in the here and \nnow, even though the goal is in the future. If we are going to evaluate whether or not, we \nmade progress today or yesterday or not, that's an evaluation of how we feel in the \nimmediate peripersonal space. However, moving toward any goal, involves orienting our \nthinking towards the extra personal space. And as we go through today's episode, I'm \ngoing to teach you a technique or rather a neuroscience -based tool, that will allow y ou to \ncontinually transition back and forth between the peripersonal space and the extra \npersonal space in a way that will allow you to update and evaluate and better execute \nyour goal seeking. The whole principle behind this, is that human beings, like ot her \nanimals, have to make evaluations about whether or not they are on the right track. \nHowever, the important thing to understand, is that humans in particular can do this over \ndifferent timescales. We don't just pursue food 'cause we are hungry, we pursu e food, \nexcuse me, for a particular meal, that we might be having with people tomorrow. We can \nmodulate the timescale in a way that other animals don't. That's how we adjust our goal \nseeking, to different timescales. And in addition to that, humans are exq uisitely good at \nbiasing our behavior toward particular goals over very long periods of time. But there are \na lot of mistakes out there, in fact, things that are outright wrong in the literature and in \nparticular, in the internet, and then the kind of well ness and fitness and cognitive fitness \nspace, that send people down the wrong path and those things we will talk about in a \nfew minutes.

Let's start with a simple one. We've all heard that multitaskin g is bad. \nWe've heard multitasking is bad, it doesn't allow for focus. If you want to achieve \nanything, if you want to accomplish anything, you should not multitask. Well, it turns out, \nthat's wrong. It turns out that there is a role for multitasking, but the multitasking has to \nbe placed at a particular time within your goal seeking behavior in order to be effective. \nReally nice studies done at Carnegie Mellon University, and the Davis Lab, evaluated \nhow long people are able to focus in different environme nts. How long they were able to \nstay concentrated on their work. And it turns out that number is exceedingly low. It turns \nout that most people, whether or not they're doing computer work or whether or not \nthey're doing writing or accounting work or anythi ng of that sort, can hold their attention \nfor about three minutes at a time before they shift their attention off. And that's \nridiculously low when you first hear it, but, that probably reflects a basic state of brain \nfunction. That hearkens back to a time  when we were hunter gatherers, I doubt that we \nwere maintaining focus solidly for hours and hours and hours, unless we were under \nsome particular threat or in some particular crisis. Rather, you could imagine that people \ncollected seeds and nuts and berri es for about three minutes and then probably stood \nup, looked around and then kept going. Or that they were hunting animals or in some \nsort of pursuit, fishing, et cetera, and focused, focused, focused and every three minutes \nor so, they might've looked up  and, you know, take a look at the sky or looked around to \nmake sure that other people were there or not there, et cetera. It all stands to reason \nthat that will be the case. Again, the neural circuits haven't evolved much. Now, \nmultitasking, has been show n to have a very interesting physiological signature, when \nwe multitask, when we jump back and forth between things, there is an increase in the \nlevel of the neurotransmitter, also sometimes called a neuromodulator, but basically \nsame thing for sake of thi s discussion. There's an increase in the neurotransmitter \nepinephrine, which is adrenaline. And so, there are really nice studies now, pointing the \nfact that doing a bit of multitasking prior, to jumping into some focused, goal directed \nbehavior, whether o r not it's mental behavior or physical behavior, can actually be useful \nbecause it gets us into action. So we've all been told that multitasking is terrible, but if \nyou, for instance, find yourself cleaning up your house and also checking your phone \nand do ing a number of things, right at the point where you should be sitting down to write \nor do some focused work. It probably reflects some adaptive mechanism, where you use \naction and somewhat varied multitasking action in order to generate adrenaline in your  \nsystem, because adrenaline just gets you in the action.

Because, \nwhat's also very clear and we're going to talk about this in exquisite depth  today, is that \nvisual focus and in particular contracting your visual window, bringing the aperture of \nwhat you see, to a very fine point, can absolutely increase your clarity of goal seeking \nand the likelihood that you will pursue your goals. I've talked  about this a little bit before \non the podcast as a way of increasing focus for any kind of pursuit. I've talked about a \npractice, whereby you can literally look at a dot or a line, placed on a wall or on your \ncomputer in front of you for 30 to 60 seconds,  and then moving into some dedicated \nwork, where you need to focus. And indeed, just looking at a narrow piece of the visual \nworld, a small piece of the visual world for some period of time and forcing yourself to \nhold that gaze on that location as best yo u can, can increase your level of cognitive \nattention and your ability to focus and stay focused. And this is not magic. It is the \nconsequence of the fact, that most of your cognition follows your visual perception. For \nthose of you that are low vision or no vision, meaning you're blind, or you have trouble \nseeing, my lab does a lot of work with people, who are low vision, no vision. They tend to \nuse their auditory system, their hearing, as a way to anchor their attention to particular \nthings. But most peop le out there can see and see pretty well and visual focus is the way \nto do that. Now, earlier, we were talking about this notion of peripersonal space versus \nextra personal space. And I'm just going to seed a little bit of the later conversation by \nsaying,  that when we focus on an external point. We are in a process of exteroception, is \nthe focus on the extra personal space, not the peripersonal space. So when we focus on \nsomething, say a line on the wall for 30 to 60 seconds or at our computer for 30 to 60  \nseconds and just look at it and then move into any kind of action, whether or not it's work \naction or physical action. We are at its very core. We are engaging in this pursuit of extra \npersonal space. We are placing our focus outside our body and therefor e we are placing \nthe brain into goal pursuit mode. Work at NYU, in particular, in the laboratory of a \nphenomenal researcher in their Psychology Department, by the name of Emily Balcetis, \nB-A-L-C-E-T-I-S. Emily Balcetis, has done really nice work on this. T hey've done is, \nthey've had, people focus their visual attention on a goal line of some sort and then to \nengage in some sort of behavior, that requires a lot of effort. And they've done a lot of \ndifferent experiments like this, but I'll just explain one.

I'll give you an example of one particularly \nnice study from the Balcetis Lab. So this parti cular study involves, physical exercise. \nAlthough, as I mentioned before, they've done similar studies looking at cognitive type \nwork. And what they did is they had a group of people, exercise, wearing 15 pound ankle \nweights, and they had to basically move  a certain distance or run a certain distance to \nreach a goal line. One group was focused on the goal line, visually focused, on the goal \nline. The other group was not told to visually focus on the goal line. And what they found, \nwas that the group that fo cused on the goal line, was able to achieve reaching that goal \nwith 17% less effort. They measured effort and they got there 23% quicker. That's a \nremarkable difference. So same distance traveled, with same workload because \neveryone's wearing the same 15 p ound weights on their ankles. One group is simply \nlooking at the goal line, the other group is not told to look at the goal line, simply by \nlooking at the goal line, does something to the psychology and end physiology of these \npeople, that allows them to m ove forward with less perceived effort and to do it more \nquickly. That's remarkable. And in this case, they're focused on the goal line, but in a few \nmoments, we'll talk about how one can use updating of goal line, so incremental goal \nline. Starting with a n intermediate goal, and then extending the goal line further and \nfurther. But just sit back for a second and think about that, just by changing where a \nperson looks, they changed their perceived effort and their ability to do something, more \neffectively, more quickly, than a group that is not deliberately focusing their visual \nattention on one location. That's incredible. And it's so incredible, in fact, you might say, \nwell, how could that possibly be? Well, it turns out, it has a very specific, underlying  \nphysiological reason and that has to do with changes in our so -called, autonomic \nnervous system. The aspects of our nervous system,  \n \n00:43:50 How Vision Improves Performance: Blood Pressure  \n \nthat prepare us for readiness and action, or that prepare us fo r resting and relaxing. So \nwhat is special about focusing one's visual attention at a given location? Well, it turns out \nthat we have two branches of our visual system. So visual information all comes in \nthrough our eyes, but then it can head down two diff erent pathways. One pathway is \nengaged when our vision is brought to a common point, what we call, a vergence eye \nmovement.

Just think of it as a very detailed camera of the visual world. It \ntends to be very restricted. The other pat hway through the visual system, is the so -\ncalled, magnocellular pathway. And this is a pathway that's involved in taking in global \ninformation about lots of things, that are happening around us. Movement of things to \nour right, movement of things to our le ft, things are happening down on the ground and \nall around us. And that pathway involves a sort of relaxation, if you will, of the neural \ncircuits that are associated with alertness and attention. When you walk down the street \nand you're not thinking about  much, provided you're not looking at your phone, you're \nnot focusing on one location, you're more or less in a relaxed state, compared to when \nyou're looking for a particular sign, you're looking for a bus or a train that's coming, or a \nparticular person.  And that should inherently make sense, when your level of attention \nand alertness goes up, there's sort of a small, but perceptible increase in your level of \narousal. It's not really stress necessarily, but arousal of alertness. And it turns out that \nthe visual system, accomplishes this increase in alertness by communicating with your \ncirculatory system and the system that delivers blood and nutrients and oxygen to the \nrest of the tissues in your body. So let's talk for a second about what focusing our vis ion \non a particular location does because in this study from the Balcetis Lab, what they \nfound was, focusing on a goal line allows people, to move more effectively toward that \ngoal. This is something you can leverage in all aspects of all goal pursuits. Wh at \nhappens when we focus on a particular location? Believe it or not, there's an increase in \na particular feature of our blood pressure. Now your body has, of course, arteries, veins \nand capillaries, and your heart pumps blood, first to the arteries, and t hen to the other \ncomponents of your vascular system. And we have so -called, blood pressure. Blood \npressure is just how much, the fluid volume is pressing on those arteries, veins and \ncapillaries. So you can imagine a pipe with very little fluid moving thro ugh it, that's low \npressure. You have a pipe with a lot of fluid moving through it, that's even more \npressure. You have a pipe with a lot of very viscous, meaning, very kind of sticky, thick \nstuff, moving forward, that's even more pressure. We have blood p ressure and you've \nprobably had your blood pressure measured. There's always two numbers. You have a \ntop number, which is the systolic blood pressure. And then there's the bottom number, \nbelow the line, which is the diastolic pressure. So the important thi ng to understand, is \nthat your blood pressure will rise when your heart beats, because there's more fluid", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3059, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e5a5f928-a3dd-4409-a386-88321f88b221": {"__data__": {"id_": "e5a5f928-a3dd-4409-a386-88321f88b221", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "21", "file_name": "55_The_Science_of_Setting_&_Achieving_Goals_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_55.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "690e6c68-c026-4bd9-8de0-e0880cc2b6c9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "21", "file_name": "55_The_Science_of_Setting_&_Achieving_Goals_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_55.pdf"}, "hash": "858205eb598b899694b81080a825fac0c1bc5510f4a9adfc3961c298e5a2f175", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ff4ff648-2c48-40ca-ae2b-f8e1d95b03a8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "20", "file_name": "55_The_Science_of_Setting_&_Achieving_Goals_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_55.pdf"}, "hash": "4ab360cd48bcfbe92ebf7cf7f9b00acc206ae64f32c277474792c0a33c77e6dd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8f1842d6-475c-4a26-a7db-0fb78c250581", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "00eaf3f9eefafdfcd6bf97eb16fa590b533673425eea087ae4450fa25eaf3918", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "bf49df46d8192b5f4823fbf930c38b93812e61878c5921c623c65b34f84a71de", "text": "Transcribed by readthatpodcast.com  \nmoving through those pipes that are your arteries or veins and your capillaries. And that \ntop number is called the systole or the systolic blood press ure, because that's the \npressure at the time, when your heart contracts. So the top number, which normally, if \nyou have a healthy blood pressure, is somewhere in the range of 90 to 120 millimeters \nof mercury. Millimeters of mercury is just the way, that pr essure is measured. That top \nnumber, your systole, or your systolic blood pressure, is what's measured when the \nheart contracts. So, that's the amount of pressure when there's a heartbeat and it's \nmoving through your vasculature. Now, between beats, the he artbeats, but then it \nrelaxes, your blood pressure is going to drop to a lower value because fluid isn't being \npumped through the system at those moments. And that's the bottom, the diastolic \npressure. And typically for healthy people, that's going to be 6 0 to 80 millimeters of \nmercury. So you might hear about a normal blood pressure being about, again, this is an \napproximate, 120 over 80. What that means is, at the point where blood was being \npumped through there, your arteries and veins, boom, that it's 1 20 millimeters of \nmercury, but then, when the heart relaxes for a second before the next beat, then it \ndrops to 80. So there's high pressure, low pressure, high pressure, low pressure. The \nfluid is being pumped through the system. Now, why am I telling you  all this? Well, it \nturns out, that there are neural circuits that link your visual system and focusing on a \nparticular point with that top number, the systolic blood pressure. And when you focus \nyour eyes on a particular location, that systolic blood pres sure goes up, and there are \nsome other systems that are coordinated with it in your brain and body, that start \nreleasing adrenaline, low amounts of adrenaline in most cases. And that adrenaline, \nfurther readies your body for action. So, bringing our visual  focus to a particular location, \ndoes a number of things to the brain and the whole system of the body, to prepare it, to \nplace it into a state of readiness that makes us more likely to lean into our goals into \naction. And if we step back and think about t his, this makes perfect sense. The brain and \nbody need to be coordinated. We can't just think about a goal. In fact, a deer or a lion, \ncan't just think about a goal. It has to think about a goal and then has to feel some sort of \nactivation energy, some wil lingness or desire to move forward in pursuit of that goal. So \nimagining a goal, has to be coupled to the physical pursuit of the goal. So our visual \nsystem in a beautiful way, brings together a focus, literally, a visual focus on a particular \npoint outsid e us. Then it recruits an increase in systolic blood pressure, which creates a \nsystemic, a body -wide and brain -wide increase in fuel utilization, in oxygen availability, in \nour willingness to move forward as a body, as a whole coherent system.

This to me is a \nremarkable feature of our physiology and it gets right to the point of some of the  \npsychological phenomenon that we were talking about earlier. Let's just recall what \nsome of those are. I won't list them all, but, a goal has to be significant, they say. All the \npsychologists, all the popular stuff online says, it has to be significant, has to be \ninspirational and has to be action oriented. So let's say you look out into the landscape \nof what's available to you, whether or not it's just in your mind, or you look at a specific \npoint, you say, I want to go to that particular restaurant, to eat that particular food. And \nyou orient towards it and you move towards it. This is the way that your brain and body, \nare coordinating their actions together. Conversely, when our visual system, is in a mode \nof looking at everything. When the aperture of our visual system is very broad, we know \nthat there's also a reduction in our goal directed behavior and a reduction in the systolic \nblood pressure. It's as if our peripersonal space is sufficient, we don't need to get \nbeyond our current state. We're not o riented toward any one thing in particular. So I've \nnow described some of the psychology and some of the underlying physiology. Now, I'd \nlike to mesh this within the context of actual specific goal setting and goal pursuit. \nBecause what many of you are pro bably thinking is, well, that's some physiology, there's \nsome psychology, but how do you actually apply this towards setting and achieving \ngoals? Well, you do that, by understanding that your mental frame and your attention are \nalways either positioned, to  your peripersonal space, focused on your immediate \npossessions and state, or towards things outside you. But then you also have the ability, \nto dynamically travel back and forth between those. And so next, we're going to talk \nabout, what the literature sa ys about things like visualization, immediate and \nintermediate goals, long -term goals and how to best achieve those. And then we're \ngoing to move specifically into the protocols that you can use.

The title of the \nstudy is, keeping the goal in sight, testing the influence of narrowed visual attention on \nphysical ac tivity. And this is a paper from Emily Balcetis's Lab, focuses mainly on \nphysical activities, but it mentioned some other things as well. This is an article \npublished in Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin in 2020, so it's recent. It's an \nexceptiona l paper in my opinion, really gets to the heart of how all this works and some \nof the examples of where it's been implemented. So let's apply this visual tool, in a very \nsimple way, to any type of goal that you want to pursue. If you already know what goal  \nyou want to pursue, maybe it's a workout, maybe it's a cognitive work of some particular \nsort. Again, the process is very simple. You're going to focus your visual attention on one \npoint beyond your peripersonal space, so it could be on your computer. It could be on \nthe wall, it could be a horizon. It could be at a distance and you're going to focus your \nvisual attention there. And with some effort you're going to hold your visual attention for \n30 to 60 seconds, you might blink, that's okay, but you're goi ng to try and hold your \nvisual attention there. So no moving your head around. No diverting your attention to \nother locations. Some people will find it very easy to do. Other people will find it quite \nhard. Your mind may drift cognitively, that's okay, but  try and bring your visual attention \nto that common point. Several episodes ago, I talked about how, there are actually \nstudies looking at developing this kind of training in students, for ADHD and the data on \nthat are actually quite encouraging. So for pe ople who have ADHD and focus issues and \nattentional issues, this can be effective. For people who don't, this can also be effective. \nAgain, it places your brain and body into a state of readiness and then the idea is to \nmove into the particular actions, th at bring you closer to your goal. We haven't yet talked \nabout how to set goals and how to assess progress. This is simply how to pursue goals. \nBut the visual component is important, in fact, I would argue that the visual system and \nharnessing your visual a ttention to a narrow point, is going to be the most effective way, \nto get your brain and body into a mode of action, to pursue whatever goal it is you're \ntrying to pursue. That practice is in stark contrast to multitasking, where by definition \nyour attenti on is moving from place to place to place. I mentioned that multitasking can \nbe effective in getting your system into somewhat of an increased level of activation, so \nthat you can pursue a more focused goal. But the visual attention to a particular point, is \ngoing to be the most effective way to bring your system", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2982, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b3585424-cd4b-4fbe-bbed-f27a452d900e": {"__data__": {"id_": "b3585424-cd4b-4fbe-bbed-f27a452d900e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "24", "file_name": "55_The_Science_of_Setting_&_Achieving_Goals_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_55.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4170473a-104d-4cfe-88f3-8bb8d11eee14", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "24", "file_name": "55_The_Science_of_Setting_&_Achieving_Goals_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_55.pdf"}, "hash": "abed58916257f61ec1f33663999702bbbb608ce5fc981faf2ad495a68f81e13b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d1c06bf6-b9b8-43d1-a016-348fbf9b94a2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "23", "file_name": "55_The_Science_of_Setting_&_Achieving_Goals_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_55.pdf"}, "hash": "d21a1fc4c7cb66b3ce4af4bf4c1f0787b53278a66eb51e344876c3d4429d3a29", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "50ae0d03-cb66-4f53-9804-c5e2d4df5ba8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d72e774fe66b444f327baa7b53fb3f09f0f5568108e011e96bd4b9ff38dd03a9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "c1974030d9a8028286dea1257edd902f9183667cc30a9f05884417ee17da573f", "text": "Transcribed by readthatpodcast.com  \n00:54:40 Tool 3: Use Aged Self -Images to Self -Motivate  \n \ninto a state of readiness and action for goal pursuit. There's another really interesting \nway, that you can leverage your visual system to ward long -term goals. The Balcetis Lab \nhas also done, some really interesting experiments, looking at people's ability to set and \nstick to long -term goals. And the long -term goal that they looked at, was one related to \nsaving money for later in life. This is something that a lot of people struggle with, a lot of \npeople have a hard time investing money or saving money for later in life. Simply \nbecause as human beings, we vary in the extent to which we worry about what's going \nto happen later. There's also a phenomenon of so -called, delay discounting. Delay \ndiscounting, is the fact that goals, become less rewarding when they exist further out in \nthe future. You may have experienced this walking past a donut shop. I love donuts I'm \njust going to admit it, over and over again on the spot. I love the smell of them. I love the \ntaste of them. I try to eat them 'cause I'm told they're not that good for me and indeed, I \ndon't think they are. I occasionally cave and I'll eat one or many. But in general, I try not \nto ca ve to the immediately rewarding properties of the smell and the taste of the donut. \nBut, what we know is that if you smell a donut or you smell a wonderful piece of food, in \nthe immediate term, it brings your level of focus, your mental focus to the immedi ate \nphase. And it feels very rewarding, like if you had it now, it would just be so good. But if \nyou actually extend that reward out to tomorrow or the next thing you think, today \nhappens to be a Saturday, that we're recording, but, on Tuesday morning, I'm  going to \nget a donut. It doesn't have the same value because the reward system, doesn't work as \nwell for long -term goals. It's not as salient. It's not as tangible, a goal, especially for \nsomething like a donut. Whereas the kinds of goals that work, when you place them out \nto the longer term and can create a heightened sense of motivation, tend to be things \nthat are much more rewarding to us. So delay discounting simply says that, the further \nout in time that a given goal is, the less effective that reward  will be in motivating one's \nbehavior. And indeed you see this with saving money for retirement, you see this with all \nsorts of long -term investment, The Balcetis Lab, therefore did an experiment, where they \nlooked at people's tendency to save money for la ter in life.

And it \nturns out that people in that second group, simply by perceiving their own image, in the \nfuture, invested far more money into later life. They set aside more money. Somehow it \nbridged the gap between their immed iate experience of life and the longer arc toward \nwhat it was going to be like in 30 or 40 years. So very powerful result in my opinion, \nbecause what it says again, is that our visual perception of the future or our visual \nperception of the present, is wha t allows us to anchor our goal directed systems and our \nmotivation to take on things that in the immediate term might not seem that useful. So, \nyou can imagine all sorts of variations on this. You can imagine that every time I want a \ndonut, I'd see a visio n of myself or an actual physical picture of myself as a consequence \nof having eaten many donuts every day for the next 10 years. I don't know what that \nimage would look like 'cause I've never seen it. That's not an experiment that I \nnecessarily need to do  because I'm not that motivated to eat donuts, but I have to \nconfess, I am somebody who I think I'm pretty good at managing resources. But I think if \nI were to see an image of myself at 70 or 75, there's so many things that are associated \nwith visual image s. Like what our body must feel like, what our needs are probably going \nto be like in that state or in that age. What sorts of things we may or may not still be able \nto do at that age. And that anchors back to immediate goal -directed behaviors, such as \nsetting aside money for retirement. Such as investing in one's health practices. And \nindeed there's a study that has looked at how people will invest in exercise and healthy \neating. If they just think about the future and what they might be like in the future  versus \nseeing images of themselves in the future, if they were to go down a healthy or \nunhealthy route. So again, the point is that the visual system, what we see, is principally \nimportant in defining what we do in the immediate term. Even if what we see relates to \nsomething in the far off distance.

Is that effective in generating the kinds of \nbehaviors that will lead you to that?

'Cause if you do it correctly, it can really serve your goal \nseeking wel l. And if you do it incorrectly, it can undermine the entire process. So, does \nvisualization work? Well, turns out, that visualization of the big win, the end goal. So the \nSuperbowl win or eight gold medals in the Olympics or graduation from the university  of \nyour choice or making a certain amount of money or finding the partner of your choice, \net cetera. That visualization is effective in getting the goal pursuit process started, but it \nactually is a pretty lousy and maybe even counterproductive way of mai ntaining pursuit \nof that goal. Meaning continuing to engage the sort of actions that are going to get you to \neventually achieve that goal. I think this is going to be surprising to people, at first, but if \nwe think back to our discussion about the physiolo gy of the blood pressure system, it'll \nmake sense. Good scientific studies have been done where people are told to imagine, \nor even script out their long -term vision and goal for themselves. What is the big goal? \nAnd they're talked to, or told to imagine i t with a rich amount of detail. To think about how \nit's going to feel in their body and the big win. And basically what happens is, if you \nmeasure people's blood pressure or other metrics of physiology, you see an increase in \nthat systolic blood pressure. There's an kind of a ramping up of the readiness and \nexcitement for that goal, but that increase in blood pressure quickly wanes. And over \ntime, that visual of the long -term goal, becomes a poor thing to rely on in order to \ngenerate the actions that are re quired to reach that goal.

Fake it till you make it, or is a phrase that I absolutely hate, \nfrankly, because it's not even clear what that means. And it's not even clear what the \nethical form of that is . I think it means continue despite any anxiety or fear that things \nwon't work out. But if you look at the literature, the scientific literature, what the Balcetis \nLab and other labs have shown, is that there's a near doubling, near doubling in the \nprobabi lity of reaching one's goal, if you focus routinely on foreshadowing failure. You \nthink about the ways in which things could fail, if you take action A or you take action B \nand instead, therefore, you take action C. You're supposed to think about how thing s \ncould fail, if you don't get up and run each morning, if your goal is, say a fitness goal. So \nlet's use that as an example, because even though I realized, people are in pursuit of \nmany things, not just fitness. Fitness goals and physical goals are a ver y concrete thing \nthat we can all get on the same page about 'cause they're related to actions. Let's say, \nsomebody sets a goal of running five miles, four times a week, minimum, and as many \nas seven, four times a week, minimum before 8:00 AM. In a previous  podcast on habits, \nI talked about the benefits of not necessarily setting specific times that one will do things, \nbut setting time blocks that one we'll do things. So you say before 8:00 AM, you're going \nto run five miles and that's going to happen up to seven days a week. One version of this \nwould be, okay, sit back in a chair and think about how great you're going to feel and \nlook, if you're doing this every day. How your health is going to improve. How \neverything's going to be, your blood markers, of li pids, et cetera, are going to improve, \nokay, fine. That's the visualization goal of visualizing the end point. It turns out that is far \nless effective and maybe even counterproductive, compared to thinking about what's \ngoing to happen, if you don't do this . The negative health outcomes that are going to \noccur, the disappointment you're going to have in yourself. The fact that you're going to \nwait until 7.30, that's not long enough for many people to run five miles. You got to put \non your shoes as there coul d be pouring rain or even hailing or snowing, outside. And \nnow you're not going outside unless you're somebody who's particularly motivated to do \nthat. So, foreshadowing failure turns out to be the best way to motivate toward goal \npursuit. In fact, as I me ntioned before, there's a near doubling in the likelihood that \npeople will reach goals of any kind. When they're constantly thinking about how bad it's \ngoing to be, if they fail. If we think back to the neural circuit associated with assessing \nvalue in our  goal pursuits, this makes perfect sense.

And so, while I'd love to be able to tell you \nthat all you should think about is rainbows and puppies and all the wonde rful, rewarding \nthings that are going to happen when you achieve your goals. The truth is, you should \nbe thinking mainly about how bad it's really going to get, if you don't do it. How \ndisappointed in yourself, you're going to feel. How it will negatively impact you, if not in \nthe immediate term, in the long -term, if indeed your goal is to reach your goal. So, I want \nto emphasize that I'm not interested in encouraging people to flagellate themselves. I'm \nencouraging people to achieve their goals. And it tur ns out the best way to do that, is by \nforeshadowing failure. And the more specific you can get by writing down or thinking \nabout or talking about, how bad it will be if you don't achieve your goals, the more likely \nyou are to achieve those goals. Part of t he reason for that almost certainly has to do with \nincreases in systolic blood pressure and increases in readiness in your system, when \nyou imagine failure. The brain and body are much better at moving away from fearful \nthings than towards things we want. I wish I could tell you that wasn't the case, but there \nis a true asymmetry in the way we are built. In fact, the brain and body can engage in \nwhat's called, one trial learning. When something bad happens, we eat a food that \nmakes us sick. We have an inter action with a person or place that we really don't like. It \nonly takes one trial to really... One event, one time to reorient or rewire our neural \ncircuitry, so that we have a bias toward moving away from that thing in the future. When \nthings go well, unfo rtunately, that doesn't often occur. If things go really, really well, it \nmight orient our brain and body toward wanting more of that thing. And we'll have neural \ncircuitry changes that will lead us to engage in that particular behavior or interaction \nagain, but it is never as effective as these avoidance circuits. So again, foreshadow \nfailure, if you're going to visualize in a positive way, do that at the very beginning of \nsome goal pursuit. Maybe intermittently every once in a while, you imagine the big w in of \nscoring perfect on exam or winning the championship or the great relationship. But most \nof the time, if you want to be effective, you should be focusing on avoiding failure and \nyou should be really clear  \n \n01:07:26 Tool 6: Make Goals Moderately Lofty   \n \nabout what those failures would look like and feel like.

The goal should be sign ificant, we are \ntold. It should be inspirational. It should be aggressive, yet realistic. Well, okay, that's all \nfine and good, but let's get semi quantitative about this. Let's at least get biological about \nthis. How inspirational does it need to be? Does  it need to be the kind of thing that is so \ninspiring to me that I can't sleep at all? Well, that wouldn't be good because as I believe \nand I know, many of you have heard me say many, many times before, regular deep \nsleep, 80% or more of the nights that yo u go to sleep, is going to be crucial to your \ncognitive and mental functioning and your ability to achieve your goals in the long -term. \nThat's absolutely clear. So, it's got to be, inspirational and exciting, but what does that \nreally look like and what do es that correspond to and how do we actually make that \nhappen? Well, once again, there is a mismatch between what the real data show and \nwhat we're most often told. Turns out, that again, work in Balcetis Lab, but also other \nlaboratories, has addressed whe ther or not the probability of achieving a goal, goes up \nor down, depending on whether or not one visualizes or sets a goal that is easy, \nmoderate or impossible. An impossible goal would be, for instance, if I say, I'm going to \njump from my front driveway,  all the way up to the road, the road's, quite a distance \naway, it's more than 20 meters away. It's just not going to happen. It's not going to \nhappen in this lifetime, it's not going to happen in any other lifetime. Not unless it \ninvolves some elaborate t echnology that I'm not aware of, a jet pack or something like \nthat. It's just not going to happen. An easy goal would be something like, can you jump? \nOr could I jump, two feet in front of me, obviously, yes. Now I'm using a trivial example \nhere, but this could be translated to any kind of goal, school goal, physical goal, et \ncetera. It turns out that, when people set goals, whether or not they are nutritional goals, \neat more of this or eat less of that. Whether or not they're fitness goals, run more, lift \nmore. Some other goals, swim less, swim more, whatever it is their goal happens to be. \nSome learning goal, some relationship goal, some attempt to modify their behavior. It \nturns out that if the goal is too easy, it's too within reach, it doesn't recruit e nough of the \nautonomic nervous system to make pursuit of that goal, likely. Now that might be \nsurprising, at least it was surprising to me, you think, well, something is really, really \neasy. there's a very low bar to achieve it. People are probably more li kely to do it. But \nturns out that's not the case, when we hear that a goal needs to be inspirational, what do \nwe mean? When we hear that something's too easy, to recruit our action, what do we \nmean?

And so they \nquickly gave up. Also, if a goal was too lofty, if it was too far from their current abilities, it \ndidn't recruit enough systolic blood pressure. Even if people could get very excited about \nsomething mentally, it simply didn't place their body into a state of readiness because it \nwasn't tangible that they could actually perhaps really achieve it. So it turns out that \nwhen goals were moderate, when they were just outside of one's immediate abilities or \nthat one felt that yeah, that wou ld take a lot of effort. But it's within range or maybe in \nrange, like maybe I can do it, maybe I can't. Then there was a near doubling of the \nsystolic blood pressure in the good sense. It didn't go into the unhealthy range and a \ndoubling or more of the li kelihood that they would engage in the ongoing pursuit of that \nparticular goal. So here we're talking about goal setting., what we're saying is, set goals \nthat are realistic, but that aren't so realistic, that they're easy. The goals need to be \nrealistic a nd truly challenging. Don't set goals that are so challenging and so lofty that \nthey crash that blood pressure system in the other direction and make you or anyone \nfeel unmotivated. In hearing this, it makes sense, but I don't think I would have predicted \nit, had they not done this very controlled study. I would have thought, the loftier the goal, \nthe bigger the goal, the more that it recruits the autonomic system and the more that \npeople are likely, to lean into the energy and effort to pursue and attain t hat goal. I also \nwould have thought that if a goal is really easy to achieve, that it would engage the \nsystems of action in the brain and body enough that people would sort of get into motion \nand pursue that goal. But neither is the case. Again, set goals that are difficult to \nachieve, but that are not so lofty, that they collapse your system and that you feel \noverwhelmed. And the important thing here, is that how we perceive a goal, whether or \nnot we think it's within reach or not, of course will vary, dep ending on whether or not we \nare rested. Depending on whether or not other aspects of our life are going well. I mean, \nwe can think that we are hot on the heels of a lifetime goal and everything's going well, \nand then there'll be some crisis interpersonal c risis, or there'll be a health crisis and you'll \nbe shut down. And then that goal seems very, very hard to attain. So we will talk about \nhow to update goals under different context in a few minutes. But, of course this is going \nto be an averaging, this isn 't something that you do just once. But the takeaway again is \nvery simple, set goals that are moderately hard to hard, but not so hard nor so easy  \n \n01:13:05 Tool 7: Avoid Goal Distraction; Focus on 1 -2 Major Goals Per Year", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3010, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d916f171-fa20-424f-aefc-6c3a00795464": {"__data__": {"id_": "d916f171-fa20-424f-aefc-6c3a00795464", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "31", "file_name": "55_The_Science_of_Setting_&_Achieving_Goals_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_55.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bebff2f5-0b87-485a-ad04-8e30bd62a94f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "31", "file_name": "55_The_Science_of_Setting_&_Achieving_Goals_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_55.pdf"}, "hash": "2e5b5ee0fdabef55f1ffe194c62c444d4061a1f8ad29c95527915ca8d6d0ce12", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "70f9b5ed-e540-4347-9af5-fecaaba22268", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "30", "file_name": "55_The_Science_of_Setting_&_Achieving_Goals_Huberman_Lab_Podcast_55.pdf"}, "hash": "0d7141ba3aee3c0160668569329836e2b56c113cd48c08f0b1bca647706747f2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "66c6c584-b458-4b24-888a-e198f287beb5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2f5f2a3efce6b85d77e78ba80a988d19f1173fe514c63fd519ae8626b96570c5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "322afdc2f9203c8f1ebdb5379e1aff02ea63d994d85d4e08026dbf369b4d2dc4", "text": "Transcribed by readthatpodcast.com  \n \nthat they don't engage your bra in and body properly. Moderate goals are best, if you \nwant to achieve your goals. Now I'd like to talk about three particular areas of scientific \nstudy, that point to goal pursuit, goal assessment and goal achievement. Previously I \ntold you, that it's grea t to foreshadow failure. That that's a great way to get your system \ninto a state of activation. I also told you that you want to set goals, that are challenging \nbut possible. And again, here, I'm paraphrasing from the work of Emily Balcetis. I want to \nbe very clear. There are a few other things that one can do in order to bias the likelihood, \nthat you will succeed in trying to achieve your goals. First of all, limit your options, trying \nto pursue too many goals at once, can definitely be counter productive.  Now I realized \nthat life is complicated. We all have multiple goals that we're trying to pursue, but if we \nhave particular goals that are important to us, we have to be careful to not get distracted \nby other goals. And many people run into this problem. S o setting one or two or maybe \nthree major goals for a given year, is going to be more than enough for most people and \nis actually going to be challenging for most people. Now, of course we have daily goals \nand monthly goals and yearly goals, but if we have  big lofty goals, we need to be careful \nnot to contaminate our mental space and our visual space with too many goals. And why \ndo I say visual goals? Well, what various department stores and supermarkets have \ndiscovered is that, the greater, the number of t hings in our visual attention, the more that \nwe can draw our attention and our goals off a line of pursuit. What does that mean? \nWell, let's think about it in the practical context. This has actually been done. Big \ndepartment stores have figured out that i f they stock their shelves, chock -a-block with \nmany, many options of food or clothing items or objects or anything like that, people \nsimply buy more stuff. People are very prone to orienting their attention to whatever's in \nfront of them. You put a lot of stuff in front of them, their attention drifts, you put fewer \nthings in front of them, their attention is more narrow. In a later episode, we'll talk about \ndesigning a workspace, that's optimized on the basis of this. It doesn't mean being in a \nroom with n othing except just your desk and a computer. Doesn't have to be that sparse, \nbut visual sparseness, actually can help us orient our focus and our behavior. When we \nhave a lot of things in our visual environment, or a lot of things in our cognitive \nenvironm ent. It's the same thing. And so if you're going to try and pursue a fitness goal, \na relationship goal, an academic goal, and a longterm life financial goal all at once, that's \nfour things. And you're going to have to come up with systems that allow you to  isolate \nthose goals in a very rigid way.

So now let's talk about specificity of goals. We've all heard \nthat the more specific a goal  is, and the more specific we are about when and how we \nare going to execute that goal, the higher probability that we will actually achieve that \ngoal. And indeed that's the case, but there's an additional feature, that's not often \ndiscussed. That is vital ly important. And in fact, maybe more important than having a \nspecific time of day or a specific end point in mind. There's a really nice study, that was \ndone looking at recycling. This is something that a number of groups, businesses, \nhouseholds, and indi viduals are trying to do more of. They're trying to lower carbon \nfootprint or contribute to the world in some general way by throwing away fewer things \nthat could potentially be recycled. So this has been studied in the context of the work \nenvironment, whe re a business decides and lets everybody know, that there's going to \nbe a greater effort toward recycling cans or bottles or bottles and cans, et cetera. And \nthen, the way these studies were done, is that the janitorial staff was swapped out \ntemporarily fo r researchers that actually measured the number of recyclable items that \nshowed up in the trash and not in the recycle, as a function of the total amount of trash. \nWhy'd I say, as a function of the total amount of trash? What's a way of controlling for \ndifferences in beverage consumption from one week to the next? Anyway, the point is \nthey were able to very carefully measure, how much people are recycling before and \nafter this call to action to recycle more. And what they found was, if they said, we are \ngoing to try and recycle more, try not to put cans and bottles in the trash. There of \ncourse was an improvement in recycling, but it was pretty modest. Whereas when there \nwas a very concrete plan and everyone knew what that concrete plan was, for instance, \nto place all bottles and cans into the recycle, not the trash or to limit the amount of trash \nby 50%, or to eliminate all recyclable items from the trash. So when they made it very \nconcrete, exactly what the action steps were, there was a remarkable, I mean,  close to a \nhundred fold or more improvement in recycling behavior that lasted many months after \nthis call to action was made.

Some of you may be asking, how often should \none assess progress? Well, that of course will depend on the given goal that you're \ntrying to pursue.

Any \ndiscussion about goals and goal pursuit, would be incomplete  without a discussion about \nthe molecule, dopamine. Dopamine is often thought of as the molecule of pleasure and \nreward, but actually it is the molecule of motivation. This is best illustrated by a classic \nset of studies, that have been carried out in both  animals and in humans. The animal \nstudy can be described the following way, two rats, each in a separate cage. You can \nprovide those rats with the opportunity to indulge in something that they like, like food or \nmating. Or heat, if it's cold in the enviro nment, or a cool spot in the cage, if it's warm in \nthe environment and so forth. And what you find is that, rats will very readily approach \nthe rewarding thing. They will, mate. They will eat. They will pursue something that is of \npleasure. Now, if you are  to take one of those rats and deplete its dopamine neurons, \nyou can eliminate it's dopamine neurons or block dopamine in the brain.

Howe ver, their motivation, to achieve pleasure is vastly reduced. In fact, if you \nplace the item of pleasure, the mate, the food, et cetera, even just one rat's length away \nfrom that rat, the rat without dopamine will not even move one length of its own body i n \norder to achieve that pleasure. And there are naturally occurring experiments in humans \nthat mimic that result, very accurately. There are certain conditions in humans where \nthere's a depletion of dopamine. And what you find is that, the depletion of dop amine \ndoes not inhibit an ability to experience pleasure, necessarily. It inhibits an ability to \npursue or go through the series of action steps in order to achieve pleasure. So \ndopamine, really sits at the heart of our motivational state, to seek out goal s and to seek \npleasure. And this is true for immediate goals that take place within a timeframe of \nminutes or a timeframe of a day, or the timeframe of a week or the timeframe of a \nlifetime. Dopamine, is the common currency by which we pursue goals. Now, d opamine \ndoes a number of things that are very interesting. I'm going to describe a few of them as \nthey relate to goal seeking behavior. First of all, there's a fundamental feature of how our \nbrain releases and uses dopamine, that's called, reward predictio n error. And the \nsimplest way to think about dopamine reward prediction error, is that dopamine is \nreleased in the greatest amount  \n \n01:22:43 Dopamine Reward Prediction Error, Controlling Dopamine  \n \nand places us into a greater state of motivation, when som ething happens that's positive \nand novel. Now, an important thing to understand about dopamine, is that it's not always \nreleased on the same schedule. There are a couple of different ways that dopamine is \nreleased. And when it is released relative to your anticipation of a reward, is key. If you \ndon't expect something positive to happen, you're just going about your day and \nsomething positive happens, dopamine and a lot of dopamine is released. I had this \nhappen recently. I had no idea that I was going to b e receiving something in the mail, but \nI went to the mail. I looked in the mail and I got something very positive. And I was really, \nreally excited about this. This is a real event that happened, just today. However, if we \nanticipate something positive is going to happen and then that thing happens, we \nexperience dopamine as part of the anticipation. So even before we get the reward, \nthere's an increase in dopamine.

So again, the biggest increases in dopamine are \nresponse to things that are positive and  unexpected. Lesser dopamine is released when \nwe anticipate something good will happen and when that happens, yes, we get some \ndopamine. And we also get some dopamine when the positive thing happens, think \nabout anticipating a great meal with friends. We h ave some dopamine churning, our \nfriends come over, then we have the meal and we also get some dopamine from that, \nbut not nearly as much as we would, if it had all happened as a part of a big surprise. \nThen, there's also the case in which we predict that s omething good will happen, when \nthat happens, there's an increase in dopamine just as it was before, but then if that thing \ndoesn't happen, for instance, our friends don't show up for dinner, then there's a drop in \ndopamine below our initial baseline. That  drop in dopamine, is the chemical essence of \nwhat we call, disappointment. Now, this dopamine reward prediction error, as it's called, \ncan be leveraged toward trying to reach our goals because it tells us where we should \nset our milestones. We can't be in  a mode of simply being focused on the finish line. \nVery few people can do that over long periods of time in a way that's effective. Now, \nearlier I talked about a study where people were focused on a finish line visually, and \nthey were moving through space  with these ankle weights on, but that was a very short -\nterm goal. So, if a goal is within minutes, or maybe even within an hour or as in with our \nimmediate visuals environment, maybe we can do that. But most goals of the sort that \nmost people are pursuing , fitness goals, academic goals, business goals, relationship \ngoals, et cetera, involve some milestones. So, understanding what we know about \nreward prediction error, we can make better choices about where to place the \nmilestones, how far out in the future  to place milestones. So then the question becomes, \nhow often or at what intervals should one assess progress? And it turns out this is very \nsubjective, but that there's a way to make it objective. Now, in a previous episode of the \n\"Huberman Lab Podcast\", I had a discussion with the great Robert Sapolsky and we \nwere talking about, how the brain can subjectively change whether or not a given \nbehavior or experience, is positive or negative. And the example that Robert gave, is a \nreally phenomenal one. It's a study that's been done in rats and also in humans where \nthey took a rat and they had a rat run on a running wheel. Rats turns out like to run them \nrunning wheels and the blood pressure of that animal, the health metrics for that animal, \nthe lipid profiles,  many, many things improved. The rat was exercising and it got \nhealthier and presumably happier, we don't know, we could've asked it, but we wouldn't \nknow. It doesn't know how to tell us, but we can measure blood lipids.

And indeed, when that rat exercised or when \npeople exercise, they generally get healthier. Except, in that particular experiment, they \nhad another animal where every time rat number one, ran, rat number two was forced to \nrun. It was on a running wheel and it was forced to run, not because it wanted to, but \nbecause it was forced to. And what was remarkable, is that the physiological effects of \nbeing forced to do something, were in the complete opposite direction as they were \nwhen those sa me behaviors were undertaken voluntarily. In other words, the rat that was \nchoosing to run, got healthier and the rat that was forced to run became unhealthy, \nblood pressure went up in a direction that wasn't effective and useful. Blood lipids got \nworse. S tress hormones went up, et cetera, et cetera. And you see the same thing in \nhumans. Now, what this says, is that our subjective understanding of why we are doing \nsomething, is fundamentally important for the effects that we will get from that behavior. \nAnd indeed the effects of that behavior will have on us. So this has two major \nimplications. First of all, in terms of reward schedules, we can decide to use any reward \nschedule that we want for a given behavior. We can decide that the milestones for a... \nLet's say a plan of getting in really terrific cardiovascular shape over the next year. We \ncan decide to assess every day and ask ourselves how good was our progress. And if \nwe made progress, then we're going to reward ourselves. We could do that every third \nday. We could do it every week. We could do it every five minutes, if we actually had the \ntime to do that. The reward schedule, the dopamine system, is highly susceptible to the \nsubjective effects. These so -called, top -down effects of when we decide that s omething \nis going to be good for us, if we analyze it on a given timeframe, well, then it's going to \nbe good for us. So, what I suggest people do is pick a particular interval at which they \nare going to assess progress. And if you've been making regular pr ogress towards a \ngoal that you reward yourself and the reward indeed is all cognitive. It's all mental. It's \ntelling yourself, yes, I'm on the right track. Now, some people will say, wait, but I want to \nknow exactly how often I should do that. You need to do that at an interval that you can \nmaintain consistently. So you're not going to reward yourself every minute or every step \nof every jog that you take, unless you can do it, every minute of every step of every jog \nthat you take. For that reason, I think t hat daily or ideally, weekly assessments are going \nto be best. I think that checking in at the end of a week, looking back on the previous \nweek and assessing how well you performed in pursuit of a given goal.

So that's one point, that pick \na milestone that you can main tain consistently throughout the pursuit of a goal. The \nsecond thing, is that the subjective effects that were described by that Sapolsky study or \nthat Sapolsky described rather, are absolutely essential for all aspects of goal seeking \nbehavior. We cannot underestimate the extent to which the dopamine system and our \nsense of whether or not we are on the right track, is under our cognitive control. If we \nconstantly place ourselves into a mode of thinking that we are failing, well, then indeed, \nwe are not goi ng to churn out much dopamine. Now, earlier, I said, we need to predict \nand visualize failure, but that is not the same thing as thinking about ourselves as failing. \nWe need to predict what the outcome would be if we failed, but then encountering that \nand in behaving in a certain way, and thinking in a certain way, in pursuing our goals in \nan effective way. Maybe checking in on that each week, we definitely need to reward \nourselves cognitively for the correct and successful pursuit. What this means is that \nanticipate and think about failure as a mechanism of generating motivation and indeed \nfear and anxiety, so that you lean into the correct behaviors and you lean away from the \nincorrect behaviors to reach your goal. But then weekly or so, whatever you can \nmaintain consistently, you absolutely want to reward yourself cognitively by telling \nyourself, I'm on the right track. I got another week where I accomplish, whatever it is that \nI'm trying to accomplish. A concrete example that I'm following now, is this 15 0 to 200 \nminutes of zone two cardio per week, because that's shown to be very effective in \nimproving mental and physical health metrics. So once a week, I'll check in with myself. \nIf I reach that 150 to 200 minutes threshold, then I'll reward myself simply  by checking off \na box and saying, okay, I'm on track. I'm on track. I'm on track. This dopamine system is \ncritical to re -up, to remind ourselves that we are on track, if indeed we are on track \nbecause dopamine itself provides a state of motivation and rea diness to continue in the \nregular pursuit of our goals. Dopamine, the molecule, is actually used to manufacture \nepinephrine and norepinephrine. Which are other molecules in our brain and body, \nwhich put us into that readiness and action state. There are ac tually the molecules that \nhelp generate that increase in systolic blood pressure, that puts us into a state of \nreadiness. So you can think about dopamine as a self amplifying system, provided that \nyou are leveraging the dopamine system on a consistent sche dule. Now, by also \nfollowing a consistent schedule of self reward, you set yourself up for any positive \nunanticipated rewards, that may happen. So for instance, if you're checking in with \nyourself weekly, telling yourself that you're doing well, if indeed you are.

But you're doing something, you find yourself performing particularly well, \nthat's a unexpected dopamine reward that will furthe r amplify the system. Now I know \nmany people out there, having heard me talk about dopamine before, worry, well, can I \nrelease too much dopamine and then the whole system will crash and then I'll run out of \nmotivation? In general, that doesn't happen unles s people are using pharmacology, \nsupplements or prescription drugs or illicit drugs to increase dopamine. This is why I'm a \nbig fan of things like, cold showers and cold water exposure, which has been shown to \nlead to long -lasting 2.5 X increases in dopami ne, or in some cases, supplementation \nwith things like L -Tyrosine, which are precursors to dopamine. Or in some cases, \ncaffeine, which can increase the number of dopamine receptors that we have, so that \nwhatever dopamine we have floating around can be more  effective in activating these \nmotivational states. But things that really increase dopamine and then cause it to crash, \ncan be problematic. One way to conceive of dopamine, is as a sort of dopamine wave \npool. You've probably seen these wave pools, where s ome pressure is pushed into the \npool and then you get these waves going. If those waves are consistent enough, and \nthey're are of high enough amplitude, the waves can continue to go up and down and up \nand down. But if it's a giant wave, if you get a huge b last of dopamine, well then a bunch \nof the water sloshes out of the wave pool and then you basically have to take some time \noff, reset that dopamine level. That's what happens in addiction and when people start \npushing in a lot of drugs or other things int o the system that increase dopamine too \nmuch. So today we've almost exclusively been talking about behavioral tools. It is \npossible to incorporate supplements and things of that sort, that can increase dopamine \nas a way to getting into ongoing motivational  states.

Really wonderful work that was \ndone by Wolfram Schultz, who's one of the great pioneers in this area of dopamine and \ndopamine reward prediction error, showed that for people that have normal levels of \ndopamine, their visual search, meaning how they s canned visual environments, tends to \nbe pretty constrained. They might move their eyes around a particular visual \nenvironment, searching somewhat. For people that lack dopamine, they actually have \nvery little movement of their eyes. They don't actually ten d to look very far into the \nhorizon. They're don't have that very focused vergence point that we're talking about that \nkind of a... I guess for lack of a better phrase, that kind of eye of the tiger, focus on a \ngoal. Rather, their eye movements are deplete d and they're not actually evaluating \nhorizons off in their future, they're not focused so much on the extrapersonal space. And \nthis actually can be restored and some of these took place in Parkinson's patients and \nother people who have dopamine depleted, that when dopamine is restored \npharmacologically, their visual focus is re -enhanced again. Now, there are a lot of details \nto this study that don't map perfectly onto everything that I've talked about. But the point \nis this, when we are focused on a partic ular point in visual space or a particular goal or \nhorizon. All those systems, our blood pressure, epinephrine and indeed dopamine, get \nrecruited to put us into a state of readiness and willingness to go pursue things in that \nextrapersonal space. When our visual attention is very diffuse, all of that relaxes, and we \ntend to be more comfortable staying in the place that we are, in our peripersonal space \nand the effect works in the other direction too. When dopamine is increased, our visual \nattention for part icular things out in space, increase. So the way it works is reciprocal. \nWhen we use our visual system and in a particular way, bring it to a point of focus, it \nrecruits chemical and neural systems in our brain and body that put us into a state of \nreadines s and pursuit. And, when we increase certain chemicals in our brain and body, \nlike epinephrine, like dopamine, then we also allow our visual system to be in a state of \nlooking out at particular locations in our visual world. So the system works in both \ndirections and some people leverage this by using things like caffeine or taking things \nlike L -Tyrosine to increase dopamine. And again, it works both ways, there's no right or \nwrong way to do it.

I do \nhope to get her as a guest on the podcast, by the way. First of all, set goals that are \nchallenging, but possible, those moderate goals, not super easy, not super difficult. But \nmode rately challenging goals, seem to be the most effective in moving people towards \ntheir goals over the short and longterm. Second, plan concretely, you need a concrete \nset of actions that you're going to follow in order to reach your goals. Third, foreshado w \nfailure. This is a somewhat surprising one to me. I would have anticipated, that imagining \nsuccess is the way to go. It turns out that imagining success and visualizing success, \ncan be useful at the outset of a goal and maybe every once in a while in pur suit of that \ngoal. But that it's not terrific for putting you in constant pursuit of that goal, rather, \nforeshadowing failure, visualizing failure and all the terrible things that it's going to bring, \nseems to be more effective. And that maps very well to what's known about the neural \ncircuitry and the involvement of the amygdala. Focus on particular visual points as a way \nto harness your attention and to remove distractors. Removing distractors and getting \nyour body and brain into a mode of activation.

But I want to be sure to include a tool, that's been \nespecially powerful for me, that's grounded in the neuroscience research and in the \npsychology research. And as I describe this tool next, I think you'll see the ways in which \nit measures nicely with the work that Emily Balcetis and colleagues have done. This is \nsomething that, I've personally been doing for many years, based on my understand ing \nof the visual system and the understanding that indeed we can move our cognition and \nour perception from a place of interoception and focusing on our peripersonal space. \nThat space within us and immediately around us and on the things that are immediat ely \naccessible to us. That we can shift from that mode to this mode of exteroception of \nfocusing on things outside the confines of our skin and that are beyond our reach, that \nare literally goal directed behaviors and goal directed thoughts. And this is so mething \nthat in the past, I have talked about a little bit and I've talked about something called, \nspace -time bridging. And we haven't talked too much about the time domain of the visual \nsystem today. But space -time bridging, is simply a way of using one's  visual system to \nfocus on the peripersonal space and interoception. And then gradually in a deliberate \nway, stepping one's focus into the extra personal space and then back to the \nperipersonal space in a way that gives you a lot of flexibility and control  over that ability \nin your daily life. So, I'm going to first describe the tool, and then I will explain more \nabout the underlying science and the underlying mechanism. Here's how you would do \nthis. You could do this indoors or outdoors, although, ideally,  you would do it in a \nlocation where you could view a horizon. It could be through a window or ideally \noutdoors, without a window. It could be done anytime of day. At night, it might be a little \nmore challenging, but it goes the following way. What you fir st do, is you would close \nyour eyes, this could be done sitting or standing. But you would close your eyes and you \nwould focus as much of your attention, including your visual attention on your inner \nlandscape, on your interoception. So that would be your breathing, your heart rate, \nmaybe even the surface of your skin, but really focusing internally. Now, how can you \nfocus your visual attention internally, if your eyes are closed? Well, you do that by \nimagining your inner landscape. So you don't have to ima gine your heart beating and so \nforth. But what you're trying to do is eliminate perception of the outside world. You're \neliminating exteroception and you're focusing all of your cognitive attention and your \nperceptual attention on what you're experiencing within the confines of your skin or at \nthe level of the surface of your skin and inside your body.

So close your eyes. You do breath one, \nbreath two and breath three, concentrating a ll your attention on your internal landscape. \nThen you would open your eyes and you would focus your visual attention on some area \non the surface of your body. So for me, the way that I typically do this, will be to focus \non, say the palm of my hand. So I' ll focus my visual attention on the palm of my hand. \nAnd I then do three breaths again, focusing on my internal state, but now I'm splitting out \na little bit of my attention from interoception to exteroception. I'm focusing on something \noutside me, the rat io or the split of attention is about 90, 10, about 90% of my attention is \nfocused internally, but I'm also focusing some of my attention externally. Most people \ncan do this pretty easily. Then, there's a third, what I call, station. I now move my visual \nattention to outside my body, to some location in the room, or if I'm outside in the \nexternal environment, something in the range of five to 15 feet away. And I'm trying to \nmove 90% of my attention to that external object. So now I'm really biasing my \nperce ption and my attention towards exteroception. As I breathe, I'm paying attention to \nthose three breaths, so that's why there's still 10%, that's focused on my internal \nlandscape because I want to pay attention to those three breasts. But I'm focusing as \nmuch of my attention, outside of myself, maintaining just a little bit on my internal state, \nso I can measure the cadence of those three breaths. Then I move my visual attention to \nyet another station, which is further away, typically, a horizon or something  as far off in \nthe distance, as I can possibly see. Again for the duration of three breaths. And at that \npoint, I'm trying my very best to move 99, if not 100% of my attention to that external \nlocation. And then, what I typically will do, is I will try and  expand both my vision and my \ncognition to a much broader sphere. This is that, magnocellular vision that we talked \nabout before, where I'm not focusing on a particular location on the horizon. I'm trying to \ndilate the aperture of my field of view, so I ca n see as much of the visual landscape as \nI'm in as possible. If you're in an internal, excuse me, if you're in indoors, then that might \nbe the ceiling, the walls and the floor of the environment you're in. If you're outdoors, it \nwould be to expand your vis ual focus as broadly as you possibly can. Again, for the \nduration of three breaths, then I would return immediately to my internal landscape. I \nwould close my eyes and I would do three more breasts focusing entirely on my \ninteroception, on my internal land scape or what we called before, my peripersonal \nspace. And I would then repeat that, peripersonal space, 100%, focus on my hand, 90%, \n10% on my peripersonal space or my internal landscape.

The entire \nthing takes about 90 seconds to th ree minutes, depending on how many breaths you do. \nI said three, but you could do one or 10. It doesn't really matter. Or, it's also going to \ndepend on, for instance, how slowly your breathing. 'Cause your breathing might be \nfaster than mine or vice versa.  What is all of this doing? Why do I call this space -time \nbridging? And why is this useful for goal setting? The reason I call it space -time bridging, \nis that the visual system, is not just about analyzing space. It's actually how we batch \ntime. It's how w e carve up time. And the simple way to state this is that, when we focus \nour visual attention on a very narrow point, that's close to our body and our immediate \nexperience. We tend to slice up time, very finely. We're focused on our breathing. We're \nfocuse d on our heartbeats. In fact, our breathing and our internal landscape and our \nheartbeats become the sort of seconds hand, if you will on our experience. We are \ncarving up time, according to our immediate physiological experience. Whereas when \nwe focus our  visual attention outside our body, not only do we engage that \nexteroceptive, extra personal space system, and we start to engage the dopamine \nsystem, the goal -directed system, but we also start batching time differently. When we \nfocus our visual system in to a broader sphere of space or into a space beyond the \nconfines of our skin, we start carving up time, our frame rate changes. Now this is useful \nin the context of goal setting, goal assessment and goal pursuit. Because with the \nexception of a very few is olated examples, almost all goals, involve setting some goal, \nthat's off in the future, and then carving up the time between now and the achievement \nof that goal into milestones, that range in duration. And the rewards, even if we try and \njust make them ev ery week, are going to come at some unexpected intervals and that's \nactually can be helpful for reinforcing behavior, intermittent reward. That's intermittent \nand random is the most effective reward schedule we know, but the problem is always, \nhow do we ke ep our cognition in line with the long -term goal while also being focused on \nthese more immediate goals? And so this particular practice, that I call space -time \nbridging, but we could give it a different name. I'm sure there are better names. Maybe \nyou can  suggest some in the comment section on YouTube, that are more accurate or \nmap to it better. But this behavior or this practice rather, is teaching us to use our visual \nsystem and thereby our cognitive system and thereby our reward systems, to orient to \ndifferent locations in space and therefore different locations in time. And that is the \nessence of goal directed behavior. That is the essence of setting a goal.

Then it's about setting milestones that are intermediat e to \nthat goal. Then it's about assessing whether or not you're reaching those milestones. \nAnd then, it's of course about updating your goals, if you need to update your goals. All \nof that is an enormously confusing batch of challenges, if you think about it all at once, \nbut if you break it down into these elements, that the visual system can help you find and \nmove towards those milestones. I think there's ample evidence to support that and that \nyour control over your visual system, is indeed yours, that yo u can deliberately set it to \ndifferent locations.

And indeed things like visualization and why forecasting failure can \nbe more e ffective than forecasting success as counter intuitive as that might seem. \nThat's what the data point to. And we talked about the importance of setting concrete \nplans and really what that means. And what intervals at which to assess progress.
